        The Hello Fresh Team really enjoy the flavour of Pact Coffee, we also

      q: >-
        What was the coffee set-up at the office before you signed up with Pact
        Coffee?
      r: >-
        Prior to signing up with Pact, we were using a coffee machine supplier
        which was fine but there was no excitement around the coffee and their
        service wasn’t personalised to us.
    question02:
      q: What made you choose Pact Coffee?
      r: >-
        We love the connection to the farmers, Pact have made an effort to let
        us know where the coffees are from and who grows them. It’s become a
        real talking point. We also love the flexibility of the deliveries,
        getting the amount of fresh coffee we need on a weekly basis.

        The unlimited coffee is a key benefit for our members; we’ve had great
        feedback on the coffee and they definitely appreciate not needing to
        head to the coffee shop to get their caffeine hit.
    question05:
      q: >-
        At Pact Coffee, we believe that great-tasting, ethically sourced coffee
        plays a role in developing company culture by facilitating team bonding
        and making teams feel valued. What’s it like working at SHACK15?
      r: >-
        It’s important to us to offer the best to our members, we’re creating a
        community and being able to take time out and enjoy a cup of coffee is
        definitely part of that. The workspace is changing, it’s less office and
        more community.

      q: >-
        What was the coffee set-up at the office before you signed up with Pact
        Coffee?
      r: >-
        We were previously under contract with a coffee machine supplier, but
        the coffee machine was constantly breaking down and the company weren’t
        very easy to deal with.
    question02:
      q: What kind of office are you?
      r: >-
        We’re a fairly small team of just 40 staff, a lot of whom are often out
        and about and at meetings.
    question03:
      q: >-
        What is it about the service provided by Pact at Work that works for
        you?
      r: >-
        We find Pact easy to use: it’s very straightforward to tweak the
        requirements in terms of quantities. We like that flexibility. We’ve
        also received very good customer service from Lucy.
    question04:
      q: What’s the response been like in the office so far?
      r: >-
        We’ve had good feedback on the coffee from both the team and external
        clients who come in for meetings.
