      Our rates are low for coffee that’s <i>this</i> good. Customers typically
      pay £1-£5 per employee each month… that would hardly buy them a coffee out
      per day!
    title: At a reasonable price.

    In 2012, armed with not much more than a coffee grinder, a set of envelopes
    and a passion for coffee, our Founder, Stephen, set up Pact in his kitchen.
    His dream was to introduce the UK to better coffee at home, improving
    millions of mornings and changing the coffee industry for the better.

      “Coffee’s ability to change people’s lives and improve local economies is
      huge. This is Pact’s goal, to get coffee consumers to understand the value
      in speciality coffee and the impact their choice to buy it can have in
      communities at origin. It’s a win-win: customers get a fantastic cup of
      coffee and that revenue supports the livelihood of the communities who
      grow it.”

        Coffee is José and Maria’s passion. Based near Acevedo, Colombia, José
        bought his farm in 1989, when the whole area was barren - but since he’s
        been in the industry all his life, that wasn’t a hurdle for him. For
        José, coffee is a lot of things: a source of income for him and his wife
        Maria, a way to strengthen the community and a drink to bond and build
        friendships over. That focus on relationships is why he values his
        connection with Head of Coffee Will so much. More than a business
        arrangement, Will is a friend - and one that comes to visit (all the way
        from London) around twice a year!

        With just 33 hectares of coffee-producing land, José and Maria have
        provided us with 10 different coffees over the years, but are now
        branching out to bigger lots. From a plot of barren land to a thriving
        farm that employs around 80 people, a mix of permanent staff and
        seasonal cherry-pickers, José has made sure that his success is felt by
        his whole team. Since working with Pact, he’s been able to build new
        housing and new bathrooms for the people who work on the farm. As he
        says, his priority is “to make them feel happy at the farm, to feel at
        home” - and according to Will, Maria’s cooking definitely helps with
        that!

        Inheriting the Planalto estate from his wife Mariza’s father, José
        Armando Franco, Sergio and Mariza had a legacy to uphold. Not only has
        the farm been growing coffee for over 25 years, José himself was
        responsible for the move from commodity to speciality beans - as the
        movement for quality coffee grew, he recognised that their healthy trees
        and perfect terroir would make the move to speciality a wise one. Based
        south of Minas Gerais, Brazil, Sergio has proven his commitment to
        improving the quality of his coffee - from working closely with Will, to
        investing in his team by paying for them to attend specialised
        processing workshops.

        We refer to it as the Planalto estate for a reason: this is not a small
        farm. At a massive 908 hectares, with 430 hectares of coffee-producing
        land, Sergio and Mariza manage to produce around 12,000 bags a year -
        that’s 35 bags per hectare. There’s a lot that helps them get to that
        number; from the 3600 foot altitude and surrounding natural forest
        creating the perfect microclimate, to the large team of workers. There
        are 40 permanent staff at Planalto, with an additional 50 during the
        harvesting period. By providing them with good housing, water and waste
        services, access to education and wages that are above regional
        standards, Sergio and Mariza show them what a valuable part of the farm
        they really are.

        Marcus Carvalho spent the earlier part of his career as a professional
        football player in Brazil. But after marrying Maria José Barros
        Junqueira, Maria’s father passing away meant that they inherited a farm.
        And Marcus really got stuck in. His hard work meant that his coffee
        scores and volume produced went up, winning him recognition in the
        coffee field - not just in his coffee fields! Sadly, Marcus’ wife was
        the victim of a car accident, which understandably turned his life
        upside down. While he considered abandoning the farm in his grief, he
        decided to honor the hard work and memory of his wife and her father by
        continuing to keep it going.

        Marcus himself says it best: “as my farm is small, I cannot accept
        produce defects. All my coffees have to get more that 80 points”. And at
        just 60 hectares of farmland, 27 of which produces coffee, he’s got a
        point. This attitude means he averages around 84 points for his coffee,
        but his forward-thinking approach to his workforce also contributes to
        this. When he first got started, Marcus realised he was having trouble
        finding people to help harvest cherries due to competition from
        neighbouring farms. Quality is impacted by an early or late harvest, so
        he knew it was worth paying more to get the right workers at the right
        time.
