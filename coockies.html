              Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile

              logging in, they are identified using an anonymous token or ID. </p><br>

              of how many visitors the Website receives every day and which sections of

                    We pay for advertising from marketing partners on other sites, for example 
                    Facebook/LinkedIn. These third parties sometimes require that we put a tiny image ("pixel") from 
                    their site on any landing pages that users might arrive at. These pixels can create cookies for the 
                    third party so we can work with them to understand how successful their marketing campaign was. We 
                    also need to understand where a user came from, so that, if the user goes on to sign up on our Website, 
                    we can pay the correct marketing partner for their service. This website uses retargeting services 
                    from the social network Facebook. Facebook collects certain information via cookies to determine which

              Cookies help you to get the most out of our Website. It is certainly possible to 
              delete and / or block cookies, however, this may cause the functionality described 
              above to fail. For example, deleting our proprietary cookies might mean that you 
              cannot log in and view your account pages, or purchase items from the store. Deleting 
              third party cookies is less likely to cause a buggy experience, but it does mean that
