Hi! My name is Gabrielle, and I’m in the midst of Pact to distribute great
coffee!

I’ll drink coffee all day. I’m almost tempted to forsake water for it
(although, a cup of coffee _is_ 98.7% water, on average!).

My earliest memories of it are cloth filtered brews in tall steel pots on my
grandmother’s hob way back home in Brazil. Back then, I had no idea the coffee
industry existed–and ironically enough, Brazil is the world’s largest exporter
of coffee!–nor that I would come to love it as I do. So much so, that my
fervent wish is to make everyone love it, too! I find that coffee is a good
excuse for any occasion, from social gatherings, to a moment alone, to study,
to work, to not work, and mainly, for palatable enjoyment.My background lies
in graphic design, but I’ve chosen to find and relentlessly consume and share
fantastic coffee instead. I’ve got a number of odd hobbies and habits, such as
playing air drums, or doing things in multiples of three. I’m on to my third
(!) month at Pact, and am happy to report that I’ll be ensuring your coffee is
as amazing as ever.
