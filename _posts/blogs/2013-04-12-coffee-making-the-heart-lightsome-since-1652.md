The history hipsters at [Retronaut.com](http://www.retronaut.com) are known
for plundering all things ‘olden days’ to unearth some real gems. Surprise,
surprise this caught our eye. It’s potentially the oldest coffee advert in the
world, dating back to 1652, and it just goes to show how far we’ve come since
the days when the “Grain or Berry called Coffee, groweth upon little Trees,
only in the Deserts of Arabia.”

Read on for some vintage coffee know-how and ten reasons it’s been a good idea
to drink coffee for more than 350 years…

Ten excellent reasons to drink coffee*

  * It forcloseth the Orifice of the Stomack, [and] its very good to help digestion.
  * Quickens the Spirits, and makes the Heart Lightsome.
  * Is good against sore Eys, and the better if you hold your Head o’er it, and take in the Steem that way.
  * It supresseth Fumes exceedingly, and therefore good against the Head-ach, and will very much stop any Defluxion of Rheumas, that distil from the Head upon the Stomach, and so prevent and help Consumptions and the Cough of the Lungs.
  * It is excellent to prevent and cure the Dropsy, Gout, and Scurvy.
  * It is known by experience to be better then any other Drying Drink for People in years, or Children that have any running humors upon them, as the Kings Evil. &c.
  * It is very good to prevent Mis-carryings in Child-bearing Women.
  * It is a most excellent Remedy against the Spleen, Hypocondriack Winds, or the like.
  * It will prevent Drowsiness, and make one fit for Busines, if one have occasion to Watch, and therefore you are not to drink of it after Supper, unless you intend to be watchful, for it will hinder sleep for 3 or 4 hours.
  * It is neither Laxative nor Restringent.

* According to someone who lived over 350 years ago.

Ye Olde coffee brewing instructions

“It is a simple innocent thing, composed into a drink, by being dryed in an
Oven, and ground to Powder, and boiled up with Spring water, and about half a
pint of it to be drunk, fasting an hour before and not Eating an hour after,
and to be taken as hot as possibly can be endured; the which will never fetch
the skin off the mouth, or raise any Blisters, by reason of that Heat.”
