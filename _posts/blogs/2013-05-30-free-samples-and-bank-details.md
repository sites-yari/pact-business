title: Free Samples and Bank Details
---

A number of people have recently asked us why we ask for payment details in
order to sign up, even when someone has a voucher for a free sample of coffee.
We’re concerned that some of our communications have not been clear, and are
now reviewing everything we write to ensure this is is corrected going
forward.

In the meantime, I thought it best to write a full explanation of how we work,
and why we’ve chosen to ask for bank details upfront for all users.

**The Fresh Coffee Conundrum**

I launched Pact in order to introduce the UK to the pleasure of fresh roasted
coffee. I believe that specialty coffee is beautiful and profound, and can
change the way you look at the day. Yet many people find it too risky to try,
as it is double the price of a bag of supermarket grounds.

**Free Trial FTW**

We realised that the best way to give people a chance to try our coffee was to
offer a free bag of the fresh stuff, and let them decide for themselves
whether it’s worth paying a little extra for. But for a 5-person startup in
Bermondsey, that’s not cheap. It could bankrupt us if we don’t make it as easy
as possible for those who love our coffee to order more. We do that by asking
for bank details upfront.

**And For Those Who Aren’t Impressed?**

Anyone who tries our coffee and doesn’t see the light can unsubscribe
immediately, and will never be charged a penny. Rather than erecting barriers
to unsubscribing, we’ve worked hard to make this simple too; you can cancel in
a single click via their account page, by phone on 0207 231 2047 or by
emailing ahoy@pactcoffee.com.

**Is There Another Way?**

Yes. We considered each of the following, but decided that our current model
is best for users, without leaving us open to unreasonable risk:

– Offer 50% off the first bag, rather than making it free

– Ask for the full price for the first bag, but highlighting our money-back
guarantee

– Offer the first bag free, but ask for commitment to one future purchase
(essentially BOGOF)

As a company, we strive to put the customer at the heart of everything we do,
whilst achieving our aim of making fresh roasted coffee accessible. We think
we’re doing a pretty good job, but always welcome your feedback.

If you think there is a better alternative to our current model, I’d love to
speak to you. You can get me on stephen@pactcoffee.com or by phone on the
number above.

Very best,
