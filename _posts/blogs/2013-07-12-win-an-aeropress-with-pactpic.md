This week we’re launching our
[#pactpic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pactpic&src=hash "#pactpic")
competition. Share a picture of your “coffee moment” with us for a chance to
win an Aeropress coffee maker!

The deadline for entries is Friday 26th July, and you can enter by tweeting
your photo with the
[#pactpic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pactpic&src=hash "#pactpic")
hashtag, or emailing it to us at
[ahoy@pactcoffee.com](mailto:ahoy@pactcoffee.com "ahoy@pactcoffee.com").

There can only be one winner, so it’s time to get snapping!*
