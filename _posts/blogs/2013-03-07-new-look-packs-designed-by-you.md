title: New Look Packs, Designed By You!
---

Whether via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/yourgrind),
[email](mailto:ahoy@yourgrind.com) or [face-to-
face](https://foursquare.com/v/yourgrindcom/51237418704303b1377150fc),
YourGrind thrives on feedback from you guys to ensure we’re making good
decisions.

In recent weeks we’ve noticed quite a bit of problems with our packaging.
Whilst everyone seems to love the style, the personal messages and the smell
as it’s opened (caused by being kept next to the grinder, not lotions or
potions…), a few of you have been frustrated by the size. Our packs were too
wide to fit through 15% of letterboxes, and were also a tad wasteful, despite
our best efforts.

We set our minds to the challenge and are thrilled with the results – I hope
you are too. Each pack is still 250g (a little larger than a standard
supermarket bag) and well protected from knocks, the British weather, and
over-zealous postmen. But it’s leaner. Nearly 35% leaner in fact with a carbon
footprint to match!

Check out these taster pics, and let us know what you think as soon as a new
box lands on your matt.

_“Oh and one more thing…”_

We’ve made it easier for you to tell us how you like our coffee (see bottom
right!) Just tick a box, snap and email or tweet it back to us!
