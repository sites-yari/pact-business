title: Express clean your espresso machine
---

**To get the most out of your espresso machine, you need to give it a little
love and attention.**

Follow these simple steps every 3-4 days to keep your coffee tasting great…

To clean the steam wand, take a damp thin cloth and pop the base of the wand
in the cloth. Tie the cloth around the wand, so it stays put. Push the wand
back into the drip tray area and set the wand to steam for 5 seconds (be
careful of the steam). This loosens up any milk residue that has accumulated
during the day, so that you can wipe the wand clean easily.

Remove the group handle and empty the basket of any coffee grounds, like you
usually would. Then, use a spoon to lever the basket out.

To clean the basket we use coffee-machine cleaner, which gets rid of any
coffee oil. Damage can occur if you use other cleaners or if you put the
basket in the dishwasher. Your coffee machine supplier will usually recommend
a brand (or you can go with Cafiza, the one we use).

Mix a bowl of hot water with a teaspoon of espresso machine cleaner. Put the
group handle and the basket into the solution. Leave them for a few minutes to
soak. Give them a wipe to remove any residue.

When cleaning the group head, first thing’s first: don’t touch the inside –
it’s **very** hot! Purge the machine a tiny bit (where the hot water flows
through the group head). Then, get a double folded cloth and wipe the
underneath. Loosen the screw that you see underneath with the end of a spoon,
then finish off the unscrewing with a tea-towelled hand, so that you can grab
the screw as it falls out. Keep the screw in a safe place! Once the shower
screen has been screwed off, the water could spout everywhere, so **don’t**
turn the water back on! Put the shower screen into the cleaning bath.

Put the blind handle into the group handle and pop it into the machine. The
blind handle comes with all espresso machines; it looks like the basket but
without holes! Now the handle is back in, you’re allowed to turn the water
back on. Purge for a few seconds, then remove the handle, being careful not to
spill the water in the handle. This gives the inside a good rinse.

With a brush, give the inside of the group head a scrub until you’ve removed
any old coffee grains. You can rinse the brush as you go. Repeat this process
a couple of times: scrub, wipe, purge.

Put a tiny amount of coffee-machine cleaner in the blind handle and put the
handle in the machine and purge. This will get rid of any coffee oil build up
in the machine.

Once it’s been soaking for a few minutes, your shower screen should be sparkly
clean. Rinse the shower screen then screw shower screen back into the machine.
It won’t be that hot anymore you should be able to put back in without a tea
towel on your hand. Tighten the screw with the end of a spoon.

Unlock the drip tray (there should be two levers underneath) and pour out any
water. You can wash the tray if you wish, but it won’t affect the flavour of
the coffee.

Extra tip: When you’re not using the machine, keep the handle in the machine
so that it stays the same temperature, and gives you a consistent brew. Don’t
leave it locked in too tight though as that could cause the silicone seal to
dry out and need replacing.
