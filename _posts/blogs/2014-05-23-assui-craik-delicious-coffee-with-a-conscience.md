We have a new coffee to present to you, and it’s special. Of course all of our
coffees are wonderful, but this stands out for two reasons.

First of all it tastes fantastic. Our rigorous – and very enjoyable – taste
tests have revealed its sweet orange and chocolate flavours, and we’ve also
picked up on a pleasant cinnamon aftertaste. If you choose to [make Assui
Craik your next coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) do let us know if
you spot any other flavours we’ve missed via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee).

Second of all, it’s a humanitarian coffee. Assui Craik, a remote plantation in
Timor-Leste (or East Timor), has been affiliated with the Peace Winds Japan
farmers group since 2003. This non-governmental organisation (NGO) offers
support to countries affected by conflict, poverty and natural disasters. If
you’re a little rusty on your South-East Asian geography, East Timor is only
now beginning to stand on its feet after gaining independence in 2002.

By providing technical support to coffee farmers, Peace Winds Japan is giving
the hard-working team at Assui Craik a brighter future. The union has also
opened the global coffee community’s eyes to an often overlooked region, which
is producing really exciting and high-quality beans.

East Timor’s proximity to Indonesia often leads to comparisons in terms of
coffee flavours, but their smokey, full-bodied and peppery coffees offer an
interesting alternative to a typical Indonesian fare. Assui Craik is a prime
example of the wonderful coffee East Timor is producing at the moment.

As you may have noticed, we’re very excited to have Assui Craik on our menu.
