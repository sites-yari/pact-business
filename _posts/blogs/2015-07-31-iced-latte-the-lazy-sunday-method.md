Ah, the Iced Latte: beautiful to make and to drink.

Here’s a quick way of whipping up an impressive drink using espresso, either
from a stovetop or espresso machine, some milk (cow, almond, oat, any will
do!), and ice.

**STEP 1:** Get a glass, put some ice in it.

**STEP 2:** Pour your milk in.

**STEP 3:** Tip in your espresso and watch it’s onctuous majesty disperse in
the milk.

**DONE!** How easy was that?
