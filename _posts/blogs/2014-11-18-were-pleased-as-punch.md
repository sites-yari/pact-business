We know him as “The Grande Fromage”, but to the people at The Food Awards
Company, our founder Stephen is simply: Investec Food & Drink Entrepreneur of
the Year 2014 – and, needless to say, we’re pretty proud of him. He received
this honour last week, at a new annual award launched by The Food Awards
Company and partnered with the [Business is GREAT
Britain](http://www.greatbusiness.gov.uk/) campaign.

**Rubbing shoulders with the movers and shakers.  
** The awards were set up to showcase innovation in the food and drink sector
and we’d agree it comes at a good time given the British food and drink scene
is buzzing right now! The judges in the awards were an impressive bunch of
entrepreneurs themselves including Julian Metcalfe of Pret a Manger, Lord
Bilimoria of Cobra Beer, Chantal Coady OBE of Rococo Chocolate and Luke
Johnson of Pizza Express.

The event gave us the chance to meet so many awesome businesses, from bigger
names such as the Saucy Fish Company and Fever-Tree drinks, through to the
smaller but rapidly growing [Mallow & Marsh](http://www.mallowandmarsh.com/)
and [Joes Gourmet Foods](http://www.joeandsephs.co.uk/home).

**We owe it all to you.**  
A big thank you to everyone who has tried us out and stuck with us over the
first two years of Pact’s existence. We’re going to continue to work hard to
make receiving great quality, freshly-roasted coffee as and when you need it
as delightful as possible!
