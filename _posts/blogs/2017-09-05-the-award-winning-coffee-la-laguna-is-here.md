**The second coffee in our Micro-Lot plan has arrived!**

In April I was invited to San Salvador to judge the National Quality
competition, an event organised by the specialty coffee board of El Salvador
which recognises and rewards the best coffee produced in the country each
year. To win this contest is the ultimate ambition for coffee farmers there.
It can transform lives, conferring the status of coffee celebrity on the
victors. Over 1000 samples were submitted and these were whittled away to a
mere 100. These then went before an international jury of twenty experienced
coffee buyers, who, like me, had flown in from across the globe. Only 23 lots
reached the exacting standards of the judges, won an award and got the
opportunity to be in an international auction a few weeks later. La Laguna was
one of the winners – and I felt I just had to buy it for Pact customers.

Since I started working in coffee I have always loved the unique flavour
profile that comes from the Pacamara variety. Pacamara is a hybrid variety
native to El Salvador which is only grown in small quantities elsewhere in
Central and South America. The larger beans mean that it is possible to
develop rich caramel notes during the roast process while also preserving the
vibrant tropical fruit flavours – think grilled pineapple.

In the case of La Laguna, farmer Gonzalo Antonio Ticas Reyes has used the
honey process to develop the sweetness of this coffee further, keeping the
acidity under control. This is a tricky thing to get right. It takes a couple
of weeks of painstakingly drying the beans in small batches. Individually the
Pacamara variety and the process are rarely found in the coffee world, so
finding a delicious example like this in which they have been combined is a
real treat!

The coffee is elegant and complex with lovely lychee and mango flavours.
You’ll pick up a sweetness like fresh ripe fruit and honey alongside a more
syrupy mouthfeel. If you don’t usually drink your coffee black give it a go
with this one. My preferred method to make the perfect La Laguna brew would be
clever dripper or aeropress. I’d do a slightly longer brew than normal – about
25% longer – to make sure I’d got all the subtle flavours out while not
risking over-extraction and bitterness. This is not a big, bold coffee and so
I would very much drink it on its own. It’s one to sip and savour. I’m hoping
we’ll have an indian summer this September as I think La Laguna would also
make an amazing cold brew.

There’s a good reason this coffee won an international quality award – it’s
phenomenal. Enjoy!
