title: Describing the way our coffees taste.

When coffee is **[roasted lightly](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/08/13/why-
we-roast-the-way-we-do/ "Why we roast the way we do.")** , as ours is, it
gives the flavours in the coffee more of a chance to shine. That means that
each coffee on **[our coffee
menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=coffeemenu&utm_campaign=20141217blog)** can treat you to a
whole different taste sensation. Here’s an example:

Obviously the way we taste things is really subjective. Flavours can depend on
how you brew your coffee, how strong you make it and even the type of water
that comes our of your taps. But Will (our Head of Coffee) likes to give you
an idea of the flavours you might be able to pick up from our different
coffees. He comes up with these descriptions by doing a cupping for all of our
coffees…

**What is cupping?  
** ‘Cupping’ is a fancy word for the tasting process, which is in reality very
simple to do. It needs to be kept simple so it can be done anywhere in the
world (from coffee farm to coffee shop) and produce consistent results. All
you need is a soup spoon, and to take big loud slurps of coffee. This lets the
liquid cover the inside of your entire mouth, including the taste buds and
nasal cavity, so you can fully experience the flavour.

**What are the key things Will looks at when he’s cupping?  
**Flavour** – ** It may sound weird but this is not what happens on your
tongue (that’s taste) but what happens in the space behind your nose. Flavour
is usually delicate and can be things like raspberries, chocolate, hazelnuts
or it can even be floral. **  
****Sweetness** – The sensation of sweetness on the tongue, which can remind
you of lots of different things; white refined sugar, brown sugar, fruit
sugars.  
**Acidity** – This actually has nothing to do with the pH of the coffee, but
refers to the tangy, fruity, brightness that creates complex tastes in the
coffee.  
**Mouthfeel** – Describes the way a coffee would move or dance in your mouth,
e.g. coating, juicy, tea-like, heavy, round, light.

**Where does Will go from there?  
** Let’s say the flavours Will gets are of dark chocolate and cherry and he
finds the acidity is grape-like and the sweetness syrupy. He’ll think of
something that encapsulates all those things, in this case, a chocolate cherry
liqueur. It’s not that the coffee tastes exactly like a chocolate cherry
liqueur, or that it’s been flavoured with it even. Will just hopes that by
suggesting that taste sensation, he’ll help you tap into what might be going
on on your tongue…

**What do you think?  
** We’ve asked quite a few customers what they think of the way we put
together our flavour notes and they seem pretty popular, if allusive at times.
