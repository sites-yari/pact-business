title: Buzzing Banana Bread
---

We’ve come over a little Alan Titchmarsh for today’s recipe. Nope, we’re not
wearing smart-casual trousers or presenting a programme on Classic FM – we’re
getting inspired by soil…

****

Did you know…?

Bananas and coffee both tend to enjoy the same soil types and the same
climates. The World Agroforestry Organisation are busy making the most of this
fact by ‘intercropping’ to increase yields and make better use of land. So
since coffee and bananas are growing happily together around the globe, why
not marry them up in a delicious dessert too?

About the recipe…

Buzzing Banana Bread puts a sassy new twist on the traditional version and is
a great accompaniment to YourGrind coffee. Plus, you can use the raisin-soaked
coffee left over from the recipe below to make a fabulous [Banana Latte
Smoothie](http://blog.yourgrind.com/post/47015335267/recipe-banana-latte-
smoothie). Both of these delicious recipes come from our Community Cook,
Rosie.

Ingredients

1 strong double espresso coffee

100g raisins

2oz (60g) chopped roasted hazelnuts

2 over ripe bananas (about 200-250g un-peeled weight) mashed with a fork

6oz (170g) unsalted butter, softened (you can do this in the microwave 10-15
seconds)

6oz (170g) golden caster or fine golden granulated sugar

2 eggs (Free Range please!)

6oz (170g) self raising flour

1 dessertspoon very fine ground espresso coffee powder (or more if you like)

1 dessertspoon cocoa powder

Demerara sugar

Method

1\. Make a strong double espresso coffee and pour it straight over the
measured raisins in a bowl. Leave them to soak until the coffee has gone cold
and the raisins have plumped up (this could be done a day in advance for extra
flavour). When you’re ready to cook,simply strain the raisins and set them
aside for later.

_TOP TIP: Keep the raisiny coffee liquid, which can be used afterwards to make
a Banana Latte Smoothie._

2\. Prepare a loaf tin (measuring about 22cm x 11cm x 7cm) by lining the sides
and base with a strip of baking parchment and lightly grease the two un-lined
ends with butter. Heat the oven to 170c or gas mark three and position a shelf
in the centre of the oven.

3\. Grind the chopped roasted hazelnuts fairly finely in a coffee grinder or a
mini processor. Do this in short pulse bursts rather than a continuous grind,
which would over-process the nuts and make them oily.

4\. Take a large, roomy mixing bowl and – using a handheld electric whisk –
beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and creamy, this will
take a few minutes. Alternatively you could use a food mixer if you have one.

5\. Beat the eggs into the mixture one at a time, making sure the first one is
properly beaten in before adding the second one (otherwise the mixture will
curdle).

6\. Next sift in the flour, cocoa and finely ground espresso coffee powder and
mix, follow this with the ground hazelnuts and finally add the mashed banana
with the strained raisins. You want to mix each in just enough to incorporate
everything evenly; but don’t over mix. If the mixture seems too stiff you can
add a little of the raisin-soaking coffee to loosen.

7\. Use a large spoon to scoop the mixture into the prepared tin and spread
evenly. Then scatter a generous sprinkling of Demerara sugar all over the
surface (this will form a lovely crusty topping to the cake).

8\. Bake in the pre-heated oven for an hour to 1 hour 15 mins until the cake
is risen, firm and brown and cooked in the centre. You can test this with a
very thin bladed knife or skewer, which should come out clean when the cake is
cooked.

9\. Remove the cake from the oven and loosen it away from the sides with a
thin bladed knife before turning it out of the tin. Allow to cool on a wire
rack and then slice with a serrated knife.
