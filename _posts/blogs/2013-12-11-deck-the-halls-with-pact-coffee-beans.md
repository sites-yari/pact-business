We’ve come over all festive – and crafty – at Pact HQ this week, so we decided
to make some rather special coffee-themed Christmas decorations for you lovely
lot!

Anneliese has made them from upcycled coffee bags and some beans that weren’t
fresh enough to make it into your coffee cup. You can see how she made them
below…

We’ve offered them up to our followers on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee) and
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/PactCoffee) and winners of these wonderful-
smelling little tree-adornments will be selected at random. If you’re one of
the lucky ones then do pop us a picture of your decoration in situ on your
tree (it’ll be nice to know they’ve gone to a loving home)!
