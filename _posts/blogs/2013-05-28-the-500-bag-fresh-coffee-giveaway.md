YourGrind’s freshness guarantee is one of the things we’re proudest of. By
always shipping our coffee within 7 days of roasting, and grinding at the last
possible moment, we can ensure that YourGrind coffee puts the stale
supermarket stuff to shame. But it can also cause occasional odd headaches.
For example, when we’re planning a big piece of promotion, roast 250kg in
preparation, and then find that the promotion has been delayed, as has
happened today.

The panic haze has finally lifted, and we have accepted that we’re facing a
pretty costly week. But we’re determined to pop a silver lining on this little
cloud.

Our mission is to introduce the UK to the joys of freshly roasted coffee. So
we’re going to do exactly that. **For the next 48 hours, we’re giving away a
free bag of coffee to anyone who’s ready to make the change, and we need your
help.**

Think of which friends would most appreciate the taste of fresh roasted
coffee. Send them to [www.yourgrind.com](http://www.yourgrind.com), armed with
the voucher code ‘freshcoffeegiveaway’. They just need to enter it at the
checkout and their first bag of fresh coffee will be on us. There’s no
purchase necessary, no commitment or tie-in, no witchcraft or trickery.

The super-supportive could also:

  * Tweet something like: _Good folks[@yourgrind](https://twitter.com/yourgrind) have 500 bags of fresh coffee to give away! Just go to [yourgrind.com](http://yourgrind.com/) & enter freshcoffeegiveaway. Please RT!_
  * _Pop something similar on Facebook: The good folks @yourgrind have 500 bags of coffee to giveaway in 48 hours! Go to yourgrind.com and enter voucher freshcoffeegiveaway to get yours. Please share!_
  * Tell the person sitting next to you.
  * Email a long-lost cousin.

Startup life can be tough, and YourGrind is no exception. But with your help,
we could turn a potentially difficult week into our most successful yet.

With crossed fingers,

Stephen & The YourGrind Team.
