**Could YOU be the Face of Pact?**

We love our customers so much that we want one of your faces to be on our new
packaging. You’ll be alongside one of our farmers, a coffee roaster and a
Grind House guru – the people that help us make coffee a force for good!

If you’re chosen, not only will your face be on around 100,000 envelopes, you
will also win a year’s supply of Pact Coffee* (which can be from our new ultra
special Micro-Lot Plan).

**Tell me more!**

All you need to do is send us a high-resolution photo (no less than 300 dpi)
of you enjoying Pact Coffee and say in 25 to 50 words why you enjoy it so
much. Please take the photo in **landscape** format.

Your entry needs to reach us by noon on Monday 21 August. You should send the
photo and your words to
[competitions@pactcoffee.com](mailto:competitions@pactcoffee.com) One entry
per person please!

A panel of Pact team members will pick the winner and four runners-up who will
get a Pact goody bag.

Good luck! We can’t wait to start receiving your photos.

**The (boring but important) small print…**

By entering this competition you are agreeing that your entry is your own work
and it is a photo of you.

In return for entering the competition, you grant Pact Coffee a worldwide,
non-exclusive, irrevocable licence in perpetuity to reproduce, publish, adapt,
communicate and broadcast or otherwise use all or part of your entry in any
media across Pact Coffee’s packaging and online and print marketing materials.
Pact Coffee will use the personal information contained in your entry to
conduct the competition and award the prize. If you win a prize, Pact Coffee
can use your name and photograph for future marketing purposes unless you tell
us not to.

Our panel’s decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.

*A year’s supply of coffee is 12 bags.

> This competition has now **closed.** Our fantastic winner and four runners
up were Simon, Dave, Lucretia, Natalie, Fiona, pictured below. We loved
receiving all of your photos and were humbled by your kind words about why you
love Pact. Thank you for your interest in our Face of Pact competition!
