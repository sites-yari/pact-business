Move over William Shatner and jog on Sean Connery, because today’s recipe
features the ultimate smoothie. But this smoothie doesn’t have twinkly eyes or
suggestive eyebrows, instead it’s packed with bananas, coffee and gob-smacking
deliciousness.

Ingredients

1 ripe banana

1 cup of milk

Ice-cubes

Raisin-soaked coffee (left over from your [Buzzing Banana
Bread](http://blog.yourgrind.com/post/47015289598/recipe-buzzing-banana-

1\. Combine the banana, milk, ice and coffee in a blender or smoothie maker.

2\. Whizz up the ingredients until thick and creamy and pour into a large
glass.

3\. Sprinkle with chocolate powder for a tasty finishing touch.

TOP TIP: If you like your smoothies to be extra luxurious you can add some
cream or yoghurt as well as the milk.
