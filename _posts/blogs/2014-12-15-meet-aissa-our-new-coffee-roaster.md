title: Meet Aissa, our new coffee roaster.
---

Meet Aissatou. She’s French. She’s got an incredible palette. And – as of this
month – she’s going to be roasting your coffee. It’s time to learn more about
the lady who’s bringing the heat…

Aissatou (or Aissa as she’s known in these parts) has actually been working in
the Pact Packing Room since April. Then in summer we decided we wanted to
start roasting our own coffee, rather than outsourcing it to the lovely Peter,
who’s based all the way out in Hereford. Along with a fair few other
applicants, Aissa stepped up to take part in our slightly off-the-wall
interviewing process.

**What made you want the job in the first place?  
** I love coffee and I liked the sound of this job because it’s new and
challenging. I always like to push myself into new things, it keeps life
interesting. In the UK now there are only something like 150 trained coffee
roasters, it’s not really a job that people think of as a job.

**What was the interview like?  
** It wasn’t a normal interview. Will (Head of Coffee) and Laura (Head of HR)
weren’t looking for someone with coffee roasting experience. They wanted
someone with an interest in food and flavours who could then be trained up. So
for the first round I was asked to prepare something delicious to share with
them.

**What did you make?  
** I did verrine – little shot glasses – filled with pesto, sundried tomatoes
and cherry tomatoes with a goats cheese cream on top. Then I did miniature
tarts; homemade shortcrust pastry with courgette, mint and goats cheese (I’m
really into goats cheese). I was also asked weird questions. One I remember
was ‘If you had to fight against a duck the size of a rhino or 50 rhino the
size of ducks, which would you fight?’ I think they were trying to make me
feel relaxed.

**Did you choose the giant duck or the tiny rhinos?  
** One giant duck. I learned about the danger of lots of small angry creatures
from that scene in Jurassic Park.

**And the second interview?  
** It involved actual coffee this time. Will did a coffee tasting where I
could ask all the questions I wanted to. It was quite intimidating trying to
work out what I could taste, and I thought they’d be harder on me since I work
here already, but it turned out to match up to what Will could taste.

**What do you think made you stand out?  
** I asked lots of questions. I thought that might make them think I didn’t
know anything but instead Will said they liked that I was interested. I find
the whole thing really fascinating.

**What training have you had since getting the job?  
** Loads! Before starting I didn’t even know that pre-roasted beans were
green. I’ve spent three weeks with Peter getting to grips with roasting. How
to profile coffee. Getting experience with the equipment. Of course, it’s a
really long process that takes years to truly master, tasting everything you
roast as you go. With every roast you get better and better but I’ve got a
good foundation now thanks to Peter.

**What’s the most daunting thing about roasting coffee for Pact?  
** I didn’t know it was that technical before my training. One degree
different can make a huge difference to the taste of the coffee. When you
think of the number of orders we do now I can’t afford to get it wrong and I’d
feel horrible about wasting such amazing coffee with a bad roast. That would
be a tragedy.

**Tell us about the roaster you’ll be using…  
** It’s twice the size of Peter’s, which I learned on so I’ve done a lot of
trial runs. I talk to it in French and I think it’s male but we’re not on
first name terms yet. Given the amount of time we’re going to be spending
together it won’t be long…

**What do you enjoy about roasting coffee?  
** The product. This is incredible coffee. I also love the fact that I can
only get better with time. You can never get bored when you’re learning and I
don’t like being bored in my life. Maybe it’s my Frenchness…
