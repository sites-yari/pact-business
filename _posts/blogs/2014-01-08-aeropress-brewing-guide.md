Aeropress](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/aeropress.png)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/aeropress.png)A
relative newbie to the scene, the Aeropress was invented in 2005 by Aerobie.
That’s right, the same folks that make the superlative frisbees.

In a nutshell this bad-boy works by forcing steeped coffee through a filter.

But when it comes to proper brewing guides, who needs a nutshell? Especially
when there are endless different techniques for using an Aeropress. In fact,
there are so many different methods that it can be pretty intimidating for an
Aeropress newbie.

Below we’ve opted to cover the inverted method. This comes down to preference
but we’ve gone for one version of the Inverted Brewing Method, as it helps you
to avoid the dreaded drip and encourages an even flavour. It’s important to
note we’ve gone for proportions that require diluting after it’s brewed…

**Here’s how it’s done:**

  1. Pull out the plunger until the rubber seal is touching the number 4 and flip the Aeropress upside down (hence the ‘inverted’)
  2. Spoon in one heaped tablespoon of medium/fine coffee, this will be 12-14g but your Aeropress should come with a scoop that’ll do the job
  3. Boil the kettle and leave it to cool for around 1 minute before filling the Aeropress to the number 2, this will be about 100ml
  4. Stir the grounds, making sure no dry spots are visible
  5. Attach the filter and paper and push down slightly until you see bubbles coming off the top of the cap and leave to brew for around a minute
  6. Invert the Aeropress over the coffee and begin plunging!
  7. Stop when you hear a hissing noise
  8. Dilute the coffee to taste with hot water – though 50/50 are our preferred proportions this makes a pretty strong coffee, so don’t forget to dilute to suit your palate

**Good news!** The Aeropress is super-easy to clean out, just pop the cap off,
plunge the coffee puck into the bin and rinse!

**Top tips:**

  * Rinse out your filter paper with hot water before you begin. That should remove that papery taste you can sometimes get and also help to secure it in the filter cap
  * Experiment with brewing times and different water/coffee ratios to mix up your coffee drinking experience
  * Use freshly filtered tap water for a silky-soft and uber-smooth drinking experience
