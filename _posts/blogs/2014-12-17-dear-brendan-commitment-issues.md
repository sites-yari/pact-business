Hi Brendan,

While I’m really into Pact Coffee, I’m slightly concerned that we view our
relationship in different ways. Pact wants to hook up every week, but I’m a
little more relaxed about our arrangement. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a
commitment-phobe and I really like the coffee – I’m just quite casual about my
plans from one week to the next. Are we totally incompatible or is there a
sensitive way I can let Pact know that I’d like to take things a little more
slowly?

Sincerely,  
Luke Wild Oats, Sheffield

Hi Luke,

I’m glad you’re being honest with yourself – and with Pact – about your
expectations. If you probe a little deeper, I suspect you’ll find that Pact is
totally open to a more casual relationship.

In the ‘Your coffee’ section of your Account Page you’ll see details of your
next date (or delivery) and a little link that says ‘Change shipping date’. By
clicking on this you’ll be able to push your next rendezvous back a bit.
Alternatively, by clicking on ‘Delivery Preferences’ you could arrange for us
to deliver every two weeks rather than every single week.

I hope that’s helpful and that you find this flexible arrangement both
satisfying and enjoyable.

Brendan
