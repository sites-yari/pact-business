After being hounded by various office managers and disgruntled office workers,
who are sick of drinking bad coffee in the workplace, we’ve finally given in
to peer pressure. That’s right…

_**As of next week Pact will be doing special bulk deliveries to**_  
_**a selection of offices across the UK.**_

**Say no to bad coffee in your workplace.**  
You can be one of the first 100 trailblazing companies to enjoy freshly
roasted, freshly ground Pact Coffee at work. We’re only going to be trialling
this scheme with 100 workplaces, since we’re only small ourselves. So, to sign
up and become part of this caffeine-infused workplace phenomenon simply email
the team on **[ahoy@pactcoffee.com](mailto:ahoy@pactcoffee.com)** or call us
on **0207 231 2047**

**Say yes to Pact Coffee at work.**  
By signing up, your office will receive a bumper box of marvellous coffee
(ground according to your preferred brew type) on a weekly basis. We’ll be
delivering by the kilo, with 1kg of freshly roasted coffee costing just £25,
including P &P. Each week we’ll send you a different coffee, allowing you and
your colleagues to explore our whole coffee line-up.

So, whether you’re a big cheese looking to treat your employees, an office
manager looking to treat your colleagues or a syndicate of workers looking to
treat yourselves – Pact Coffee is here. And when it comes to seriously good
coffee, we deliver.
