[![Pact Coffee
Jonny](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/photo-3-1.jpg?w=300)](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/photo-3-1.jpg)A
passer-by recently wandered into Pact HQ looking for a coffee. Turns out his
name is Jonny and he helps run a website called Maptia.com. We got talking
with him and now he’s not only a Pact customer, but writes a few Pact Coffee
blog posts for us in return for squatters rights on a desk at Pact HQ a few
days a week.

**What do you do at Pact?  
** Help the team dream up creative ideas for the Pact blog, journal and The
Perc. magazine, and essentially try to justify my presence!

**What’s your favourite part of the working day (please don’t say home time)?  
** It’s a cliche but no two working days are ever the same. I love the
serendipity of stumbling upon things (online and offline) that I didn’t
realise I was looking for. Those moments when the universe seems to conspire
in your favour. The unexpected surprises (and endless shots of caffeine) keep
me on my toes.

**Tell us a bit about your other project, Maptia?  
** Together with my two cofounders, Dorothy and Dean, I work on a startup
called [Maptia](http://maptia.com) — a place for gathering remarkable stories
from all corners of the planet that hopefully encourage us to appreciate
foreign cultures and foster a sense of adventure!

We wrote about our [1,000 day startup (mis)adventures
here](https://medium.com/@Maptia/2c85c462d508), and have been fortunate enough
to have led a relatively nomadic lifestyle, working from four different
continents in the past three years. Below is a photos of our travel manifesto
that our community have sent in from 50+ countries.

**What problem can be solved with coffee?  
** I was intrigued to learn that coffee is credited for fuelling the [Age of
Enlightenment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsFxH2zdi_Y) back in the 17th
and 18th centuries (when it replaced beer as the staple brew). If the humble
coffee bean was partly responsible for scientific method and the industrial
revolution, who knows what else it might be responsible for in the future!

**What’s your preferred brew method?  
** I am an Aeropress fanatic. It was invented by the guy who created the
frisbee, it has the thinnest paper filter I know of and gives a world-class
clean, light taste. Also it’s wonderfully portable and dead easy to prepare
and clean up.

I have been around Will (Pact’s resident coffee genius) just long enough to
grasp how little I know about the art of coffee. So I’m at the start of
personal journey of sorts to fill in the gaps of my knowledge and learn as
much about the coffee-making process as I can.

**What does your favourite mug look like?  
** It has the [Maptia](http://maptia.com) logo on and was made by my mum.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?  
** It changes but this week I’m really enjoying [The Tallest Man on
Earth](http://www.thetallestmanonearth.com/).

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?  
** More energy, and a reason to get out of bed in the morning… oh wait.

tretår day?")
