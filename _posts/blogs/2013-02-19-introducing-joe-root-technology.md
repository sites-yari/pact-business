title: "Introducing\u2026 Joe Root, Technology"
---

Hi! My name’s Joe, and I’m working on all things tech at YourGrind.

I’ve never had, nor do I expect I ever will have, such an exciting and varied
first week as the one just gone. Few technologists get the chance to look
beyond their text editor, and its been a refreshing change to get involved in
each stage of the YourGrind operation. I’ve spent the past week building
furniture, grinding coffee and writing colourful messages inside boxes!

I love it when the technology compliments the physical experience, and I hope
that chipping in across the company will help ensure that this remains the
case as YourGrind grows. Brain storming new ideas with Stephen and Ann has
been hugely enjoyable, and I’m super excited about our plans for upcoming
features. Stephens experience of growing great tech products, combined with
Ann’s sense for community, have made my role all the more enjoyable and I’ve
learnt a huge amount in such a short time.

Ultimately, I’m here to help build a product that keeps your love affair with
coffee going, so if you have any opinions, thoughts or criticisms please do
let me know. No matter how small a bug is, or how crazy an idea, might be,
your feedback can only help make YourGrind better and I’d love to hear from
you!
