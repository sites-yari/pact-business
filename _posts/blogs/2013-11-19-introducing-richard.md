Hi, I’m Richard and I find new customers for Pact.![Richard

Coffee as good as Pact’s shouldn’t be just for the chosen few so I find ways
for us to spread the word and bring Pact to the masses.

I joined the team because I’ve always enjoyed working in online businesses. I
was inspired by Stephen’s vision to get the UK drinking better, fresher coffee
which could be delivered via the wonders of clever packaging and a postman.
I’m also a bit of a tech geek, oh, and a self-confessed internet shopping
addict.

I’ve been at Pact since June and have learned so much about coffee in the last
few months – not to keep it in the fridge and what a V60 is being particular
highlights. I have also seen people find out about Pact for the very first
time, sign up and go on to give us great feedback on the coffee, website and
service which is really motivating for the whole team.

If you own or work for a website, blog, shop or magazine and would like to
promote Pact to your audience, do get in touch, we’d love to hear from you:
