Anyone else missing Brazil now that the World Cup is done and dusted? If
you’ve got a FIFA hangover and need a little hair of the dog pick-me-up, have
we got the cocktail for you!

Our coffee/cocktail enthusiast,
[Carol](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/18/carol-rocks-at-cocktails/ "Carol
rocks at cocktails."), has shared with us her caffeinated twist on Brazil’s
national cocktail: the caipirinha. Made with the Brazilian spirit, cachaca
(pronounced ka-sha-sa), this ‘coffeerinha’ is refreshing with a nice balance
of tart and sweet. Don’t worry if cachaca isn’t your thing, you can also use
vodka or rum.

_Psssst… before you get started, why not have a go at infusing your spirits
and coffee with Carol’s quick and easy guide_
_[here>](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/07/16/coffee-with-alcohol-a-vice-two-
for-one/) _

**Ingredients  
** 50ml [coffee-infused cachaca (or coffee-infused
rum/vodka)](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/07/16/coffee-with-alcohol-a-vice-
two-for-one/ "Coffee with alcohol \(a vice two-for-one\)")  
1/2 lime (cut into quarters/crosshatched halves)  
1 heaped tbsp superfine sugar  
Ice (crushed or cubed – up to you!)

**Method  
** 1\. Pop lime into your serving glass and cover with sugar – use enough to
give lime wedges a decent coating.  
2\. Press down firmly but gently with a muddler (or back of your spoon if you
don’t have a muddler) to extract juice/oils and dissolve sugar.  
3\. Fill glass to the top with ice and pour the infused spirit over.  
4\. If using crushed ice, give it a little stir and garnish with a slice of
lime. If using cubed ice, you’ll need to stir it or pop the whole lot in a
shaker and give it a good shake (about ten seconds). Adjust if you need to,
but give it a little stir in between.

**PACT COFFEE TIP:** Serve as is without straws to fully enjoy the lime and
coffee aromas. If you’re with friends, pass it around to share the joy – it’s
part of the culture. Saúde!
