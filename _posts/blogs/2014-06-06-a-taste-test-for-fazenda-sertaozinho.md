[![Fazenda Sertãozinho Brazilian
Coffee](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/brazilian2.jpg?w=300)](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/brazilian2.jpg)We
first sampled Fazenda Sertãozinho at Pact HQ. A few of us gathered around the
cupping table excitedly. Our shoot-from-the-hip tasting session involved
brewing this sumptuous Brazilian with a V60 and a cafetiere, both of which we
tried with and without milk.

All this experimentation resulted in a lot of pleasantly raised eyebrows and
“ooooh”s. The following, for all your fly on the wall types, is a rough
transcript that I captured to show you how it went down:

**Stephen:** Oooh! That is delicious through a V60…

**Me:** Can I get a little more detail please?

**Stephen:** It’s got a really pleasant well-balanced bitterness.

**Me:** Thank you.

**Matt** V60 >: That’s really nice actually.

**Me:** Which is better, V60 with or without milk?

**Stephen** <getting excited>: I think it’s a total delight black through a
V60. Even people who usually drink their coffee with milk should try it
without before committing.

**Me:** You’ve gone very quiet Rob…

**Rob** <looking misty-eyed>: It’s got a dark chocolate bitterness that’s
sweet around the edge of your tongue.

**Matt:** Nice.

**Rob:** It’s lovely.

**Stephen** cafetiere >: I think it’s fantastic black or white through a
cafetiere. Like the Michael Jackson song.

**Georgia:** It tastes like breakfast. Like toast and peanut butter toast. I
like it best through a cafetiere.  

**Stephen:** Me too. Though I’ve always been a cafetiere kind of gal.

Then Pete and his proper palate stepped in and described it as having ‘a big
hazelnut body with light apple acidity’.

So there we have it – it’s been given the seal of approval from our end, it’s
[over to you to have a taste](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees).

And just in case you’re wondering, it’s pronounced “sair-toe-zin-yo”.
