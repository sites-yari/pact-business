title: How do you brew?
---

Will, our Head of Coffee, may be an award-winning barista but who’s to say his
way of brewing is any better than yours? After all everyone’s tastes are
different. And that’s what Pact is all about, celebrating everyone’s enjoyment
of coffee.

So now we’re asking straight up, how you brew? And also, would you mind
sharing your brewing method with your fellow coffee lovers?

Here are three good reasons to pop your camera on next time you get brewing:

  1. We’ll post the best ones on this very blog, making you a teensie weensie bit famous.
  2. It’ll demonstrate your coffee-making prowess to all and sundry.
  3. Your fellow customers can learn to make coffee in new and (dare we say it?) better ways.

To share your video either:  
Upload it somewhere and send the link to
[ahoy@pactcoffee.com](mailto:ahoy@pactcoffee.com "Video brew guides") (with
the subject ‘Video Brew Guides’)  
Or send the video straight to us at ahoy@pactcoffee.com (with the subject

**Thanks in advance to anyone who gets involved. We’re excited to see what you
come up with…**
