title: Sourcing and roasting for coffee geeks
---

As you can imagine, we like to keep tabs on the world of online coffee, so
when we saw we’d been mentioned on
[CoffeeGeek.com](http://www.coffeegeek.com/) we were all over it.

The post in question was by ‘stayingawhile’ from Cardiff, who had given Pact
Coffee deliveries a whirl, and even written [a post on his
blog](http://blog.thinjetty.co.uk/2014/02/subscription-and-mobile-pact-
coffee.html) about it. He “loved the experience”, but wasn’t “totally sure
about what to make of the coffee, and freshness”. It seems both he and DavecUK
(another CoffeeGeek member) had some unanswered questions about how our coffee
is sourced and prepared, so Stephen, our founder, stepped in to answer those
questions:

Corby, the Mercanta coffee hunter

_**The Coffee Hunter:** We work with [Will
Corby](https://twitter.com/TheCaffeineKid) at Mercanta to source the best
seasonal green coffees available. Whilst we’d love to go to origin ourselves
(I mean LOVE), it would be impossible to maintain the range and quality of
coffees we offer by doing it this way. Another challenge would be getting to
know the farms and their practices well enough to be certain we are
maintaining [our Pact with
growers](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/06/24/yourgrind-is-now-pact/)._

_**The Roast Master:** Our search for the UK’s best roast master was a long
one. We spoke to a lot of people, from the Twitter celebrity roasters, the
competition winners, and the old hands. In the end it was Peter James at James
Gourmet who we fell for. He’s not just an alchemist when it comes to roasting,
but he understands what we’re trying to achieve, and supports our mission of
getting the UK drinking better coffee. We all love him a bit._

_**Our Community:** Once we have a short list of green coffees from Will, they
are test-roasted and delivered to Pact HQ in Bermondsey. We’ll cup them
together as a team and then invite 10-20 members of the community in to give
us their feedback. Their reaction is the single biggest filter we have once
Will has given us a table of beauties. Once we’ve chosen a green coffee we
love it’s sent to Peter, who will come up with 2 or 3 roast profiles he thinks
do the coffee justice. Our community cups these, and we pick the best. Pact
ends up with something that’s well-sourced, well-roasted and vetted by people
who matter the most!_

_**The Footnote…**_  
_Pact is laser focused on making our community happier. As a small team, it’s
not easy to maintain a range of regularly updated,[world-class
coffees](http://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) or [customer service worth talking
about](http://www.haebc.com/2013/12/how-i-fell-in-love-with-pact-coffees-
service/), but we won’t compromise on either. If you think you can help us
then email me (Stephen@pactcoffee.com) or call me at HQ (0207 231 2047). We
have an open-door policy, a knackered but comfy sofa and a cracking cup of
coffee on offer._

As Stephen mentions, if you have any questions about Pact Coffee then we’d
love to hear from you. We’re always keen to keep you informed about what we do
and so feedback like that on CoffeeGeek was really helpful. Do feel free to
comment below on other coffee topics you’d like us to cover… we are here to
serve!
