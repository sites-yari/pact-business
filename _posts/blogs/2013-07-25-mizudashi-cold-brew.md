The hot weather has been getting the best of us, and what better way to cool
down then with a lovely glass of cold brewed coffee. There are quite a few
popular methods to cold brewing but the easiest one we found was the
following.

**What you will need:**

  * coarsely ground (aka cafetiere-grind) fresh coffee
  * water (preferably filtered)
  * your Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Pot

1\. Place 50g of cafetière-grind coffee into the filter of the jug  
2\. Fill the jug with 600ml of water  
3\. Pop it in the fridge for 24 hours  
4\. (optional) Add a pinch of salt… Trust us on this one  
5\. When you’re ready to serve, add a little water to dilute and sweeten to
taste

Voila. Deliciously chilled, cold brew coffee ready to drink!
