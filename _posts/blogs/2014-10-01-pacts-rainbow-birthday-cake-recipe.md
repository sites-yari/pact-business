The joy of a good cake can sometimes make you see rainbows, figuratively
speaking at least. This one, however will have you seeing both literal and
figurative rainbows. Or perhaps you could make two for a “[double rainbow all
the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI)“!

Anneliese whipped up this colourful cake to help us celebrate Pact turning two
years old, and we were all extremely impressed and felt compelled to share it
with you. So get baking, brew a brew of [Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=menu&utm_content=birthdaycake)
or two, pin a tail on the donkey and share in the fun, because it’s our
birthday!

**Ingredients**

For the cake  
125g of butter (softened)  
125g of sugar  
2 eggs  
125g self raising flour  
Food colouring

For the icing  
1 packet cream cheese  
175g icing sugar  
1 tsp vanilla essence  
Rainbow sprinkles

**Method**

  1. Preheat your oven to 180℃, before greasing and lining four circular cake tins with baking paper.
  2. Add sugar and butter to a mixing bowl and stir until they’ve formed a creamy texture and are pale in colour.
  3. Stir eggs in one at a time.
  4. Sieve flour over mixture and fold in gently – it shouldn’t be runny in consistency. Divide the mixture evenly into four bowls and add food colouring.
  5. Pour each batch into a tin and bake for 15-20 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. When it’s cooked, leave to cool.
  6. To make the icing simply combine the icing sugar, cream cheese and vanilla. Stir until smooth.
  7. Make sure your cake is cool before icing. Decorate lavishly, brightly and with plenty of candles.

****PACT TIP:** We went with the Pact colours but feel free to make yours in
any hue you please.**
