We’re affectionately calling this the sugar daddy. It’s sweet and caramelly as
you would expect from a Brazilian coffee but this single estate has more
substance than many, thanks to the Cup of Excellence winning growers.

The beans are ‘pulped natural’. This means that most of the fruit is stripped
from the beans, before they are left to dry naturally and slowly in the sun.
The result is a bigger body and more developed sweetness in the cup, which we
love. Try it with a dash of whole fat milk to emphasise the creamy milk
chocolate chocolate and make it sing.

This farm has been owned by 4 generations of coffee growers (their first beans
were sold in 1890!), and the Ottoni family take the responsibility seriously.
The plantation is peppered with ecological reserves, not only protecting the
environment from intensive farming but also helping to encourage pollination
via birds, promoting general land health and reducing their reliance on
fertilisers.
