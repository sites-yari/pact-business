Since we’ve just launched two coffees from a **[brand new origin,
Rwanda](https://pactcoffee.com/coffees/ngara-nyarusiza)** , I thought it was
the perfect time to pair cake with coffee! Not that I need a great deal of
persuading to whip out the ol’ mixer and put my baking apron on…

For me, Rwandan coffee is all about great blackcurrant, blackberry, and citrus
flavours, so I’m pretty confident this coconut and lime cake recipe is like
butter to toast; it just fits.

Plus it’s a recipe of twos – so very easy to remember. Here you go!

##### INGREDIENTS

For the cake:

2 cups of desiccated coconut  
2 cups of plain flour  
2 cups of sugar  
2 cups of milk

For the icing:

100g of Icing Sugar  
2/3 Limes – juice and zest.

##### METHOD

**For the cake:**

Pop your oven on, you want it around 180c.

Grease and line your cake tin with butter and greaseproof paper. I’ve made
this a round cake, but it’s great as a square or why not do it in a loaf tin?
Whatever you fancy!

Combine all the cake ingredients.

Cook for 30-45 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.

Leave to cool.

**For the icing:**

Mix the icing sugar with the lime juice and zest. Add the juice bit by bit
until you get a consistency you’re happy with.

Once the cake is cooled take out of the tin and drizzle the icing across the
cake in whatever fashion you wish.

##### TO SERVE

Squeeze a bit of lime on your slice for that extra citrus edge.

Alternatively instead of lime, melt some chocolate and pour this over the top
to produce a GIANT bounty bar cake.

Finally, Brew up a cup of Ngara Nyarusiza, sit and enjoy!
