![Dunne Frankowski meets Pact
Coffee](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/protein.jpg?w=300)

Any Pact fans who find themselves in the dear old East End of London this
week, may want to pop into [Dunne Frankowski](http://dunnefrankowski.com/)’s
branch on Hewett Street (based within Protein agency). This fine coffee
hotspot is soon to be closing down but they’re going out with a bang, by
serving two of our very own coffees this week:

**Samambaia** – A smooth body with a touch of hazelnut and cream.  
**Zamorana** – Toasted marshmallows, dark chocolate, earthy, buttery popcorn,
maple syrup.

Thank guys, we hope you and your customers enjoy!

And anyone who’s going to miss getting their fix at Hewett Street can still
coif the good stuff at Dunne Frankowski’s Windmill Street shop.
