Here at Pact, we are always on the lookout for the best beans in the world to
make your quality coffee. And this last year has been an epic year of
discoveries.

So we thought you might like to learn a teeny bit more about the origins of
the speciality coffee you love and how you help to make coffee a force for
good.

Cue this splendid **[little read “Making coffee a force for
good”](https://media.pactcoffee.com/files/Pact_CSR_Summary_2017.pdf).**

It will give you an insight into why direct trade means a better price for our
farmers and a better price for you. You can also meet some of our talented
farmers and read about how we are working with them to invest in their farms
and the future of your coffee.
