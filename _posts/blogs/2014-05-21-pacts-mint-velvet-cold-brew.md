Summer is a truly glorious time of year. Not only are the days are longer, but
on a hot day I can almost hear the steam rising from my once-frozen cockles.
It’s like a little slice of heaven. Almost.

If you’re anything like me, then much of your summer will be spent reconciling
a strong urge to drink hot coffee and the task of quenching a never-ending
thirst. Most days I’ll stick with my regular coffee, but sometimes you just
need something cool to sip on. Well, that’s how I _used_ to feel anyway. Now I
have cold brew.

When it’s warm outside, there’s really no better way to drink coffee. Not only
is it delicious, it can be prepared in large batches so you can make sure
there’s always some on hand.

‘s take on the [recipe](http://hungrydarling.com/cold-brew-coffee/). So, now
you know about cold brew, how about jazzing it up a little?
