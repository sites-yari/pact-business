A couple of weeks ago, we launched our [Pact Feedback
Forum](http://support.pactcoffee.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-feedback),
where we encourage you to ‘spill the beans’ on ways you’d like us to improve
the Pact service. Well, you spoke and we listened and as a result we’re
introducing a brand new feature today…

**Avoid a coffee rut!**

Part of the beauty of the Pact service is that you get to try terrific new
coffees, safe in the knowledge that they’re all of the highest quality. But
for lots of you that wasn’t happening; you were stuck in a coffee rut…

**Before:** You picked one coffee when you signed up and we sent it to you for
each delivery until we ran out of that coffee and replaced it with an
alternative.

**Now:** If you opt in to our Coffee Randomiser we’ll switch your coffee for
each delivery, allowing you to try our whole selection.

**Yes** – We’ll always send your coffee – ground or otherwise – for your
preferred brew method.

**Yes** – If the Coffee Randomiser introduces you to a coffee you fall in love
with, you can switch to receive that one for every delivery.

**Yes –** You do have to opt in to use the Coffee Randomiser feature.

**How to get random**  
If you’d like to activate the Coffee Randomiser on your account, simply:

– visit your [Pact account page](https://www.pactcoffee.com/account) and look
for the coffee preferences section

– where it says ‘Would you like to receive a different coffee every time?’
select ‘Yes’

– save your preferences.

Job done.

**This Pact People Power project was brought to you by:**

Carole, Paul, Sarah, Anthony, Angela, Matt, Russell, Harry, Martin, Penny,
Sarah, Wendy, Phillip, Eoghan, Dale, Tony, Helen and another 15 anonymous
users

All of you helped to make [this
idea](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.pactcoffee.com%2Fforums%2F223203-pact-

every-time&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEzbHadCj3ScNCuhu_i3p11BL_AAg "this idea") a
reality. So, if you’ve got a suggestion for how we can make Pact even better,
we’d love to hear about it…
