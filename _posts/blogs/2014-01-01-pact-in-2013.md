It’s been a big year for Pact, our team has grown, and we’re shipping more
bags every week! But first let’s take things back to the beginning….

The start of the Pact story begins at the tail end of 2012, when Stephen
started YouGrind. His reason for founding YourGrind (as we were called back
then) is nicely summed up in the graph below:

_(Note: We now ship our coffee even sooner in the sexiness cycle, within 7
days of roasting!)_

In his mission to get the UK drinking better coffee, he spent the first few
months working out of his kitchen. All of the labels were hand written, packed
with coffee then rushed off to the Post Office.

Fast forward to 2013, and we moved into our first official office….

The team continued to grow, as did the number of bags we were shipping. When
we ran out of stickers, hand drawing logos on bags was a pretty mammoth task!

were moving along nicely. Then in May, YourGrind got into a sticky spot. We
had a big batch of coffee roasted for a promotion, only for it to be pulled at
the last-minute.

Luckily for us, our amazing community rallied around to bring us 450 new
customers, letting us ship all of our extra coffee. None went to waste!

_(450, that’s this many!)_

In June, it was time for a change of name. YourGrind was founded on a few
assumptions; people prefer the taste of fresh roasted coffee, we can help them
never run out with free next-day delivery, and they care about quality
grinding.

For our customers, the third was seen as less of a feature, and instead
something they expected from us. For this reason we changed our name to….

You can[ read more about why we picked the name Pact
Coffee,](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/06/24/yourgrind-is-now-pact/
"YourGrind is now Pact!") but in a nutshell the name Pact reflects the pact we
have with our Growers, Customers and each other!

July was the month of #pactpic. Our community sent in their best ‘coffee
moment’ photos, for a chance to win an Aeropress. [You can see the album
here.](http://imgur.com/a/zpsJY) Our favourite was this composition by
[Jarin](https://twitter.com/jahbronie/status/360728956648976384) from London:

Through September, the team continued to grow, as did the number of customers
in our community! In October, we decided it was time to launch [Pact People
Power](http://support.pactcoffee.com), our own forum for customers, where they
could submit and vote on ideas they wanted implemented at Pact.

Since then, we’ve [changed our
packaging](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/10/24/pact-people-power-smaller-
packaging/ "Pact People Power: Smaller Packaging"), [introduced The
Randomiser](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/10/10/pact-people-power-the-
coffee-randomiser/ "Pact People Power: The Coffee Randomiser"), and put
[shipment history onto account
pages](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/11/08/pact-people-power-shipment-
history/ "Pact People Power: Shipment History"). Stay tuned in 2014 for more
Pact People Power!

As the year came to and end, we were facing some of our biggest shipping days
ever. With the addition of ‘R. Kelly’ (our new grinder) to the packing room,
we were able to get our Christmas Coffee Bags packed and shipped in record
time.

The Pact ‘Posse’ has grown a lot over the past 12 months, from Stephen in his
kitchen to a team of 16 now based in Pact HQ. And we’re excited to continue
our journey into 2014.

Here’s to the next 12 months. **Onwards!**
