title: "The Best Drip Filter / V60 Coffee You\u2019ll Ever Make"
---

The V60 (the most common Drip filter method) is one of the simplest ways of
brewing a pretty stellar cup of coffee. Whether you’re making a single cup or
a jug to share, this method can yield great results if you know the ropes.

Basic Kit: Kettle, Filter Cone, Filter Paper, Mug, Scoop of sorts, Coffee, a
Steady Hand, & Patience.

So, let’s begin. Get your kettle, filter cone, filter Paper, mug, scoop of
sorts, and coffee ready. **You’ll want about 250ml of water per cup you want
to brew**.

Get your water boiling. If you have a swan neck kettle ( _pictured_ ) then
great, but any kettle will do.

Scoop we’re using, it’s great for measuring your brew without scales.

**While the water’s boiling, measure out the coffee.** You can do this
precisely with scales or, if you have a V60, then you’ll have a nice graduated
scoop ( _pictured_ ). You can start with about ~16g per ~250ml, then add
coffee if you want your coffee stronger or take away coffee if you want it
weaker.

no papery taste, and heats the vessel.

Put the coffee aside. **Place your filter paper into your filter cone and pour
a little boiling water onto the paper to saturate it.** This will remove any
papery taste that might linger in your coffee. It will also warm your cup or
jug, encouraging a more stable temperature through the brewing process, which
will help keep the taste stable too. Allow 1 minute or so between removing the
kettle from the boil and brewing.

The Bloom, 30 seconds of magic.

Now, the brew. Put your coffee into the filter cone and pour _just enough_
water to cover the grounds. This will release the gases trapped in the grounds
and ensure a better brew. **Let it do its thing for 30 seconds.**

The Pour Over.

Then add the remaining water bit by bit, trying to keep the water level in the
filter the same until the very end to ensure an even coffee extraction. **Pour
in a circular motion, without touching the paper filter directly.**

Once the water has drained through discard the paper filter and coffee
grounds.
