title: "Turns out a leopard can change its spots\u2026"
---

The craft task in this month’s edition of The Perc. is challenging
preconceptions. Not about coffee, but about leopards. We’ve included two cut-
out leopards for you to create, one with spots and one with whatever the heck
you fancy. That’s right, at long last a leopard can change its spots.

Anyone who gets involved and Tweets us a picture of their leopards (with the
tag #PactCoffeeLeopard) will be in with a chance of winning a climbing lesson
at The Arch here in Bermondsey. Coffee, leopards and climbing – what’s not to
love?

Here’s a printable Coffee Leopard PDF:

And here’s some fine Coffee Leopard crafting, undertaken by a couple of
excellent Pact customers:

**Are you a caffeine-addicted leopard who needs to change your spots?**  
If you’re looking to alter your coffee-drinking habits, why not take a look at
