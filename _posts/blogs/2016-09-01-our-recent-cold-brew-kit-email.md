Hello!

We recently ran a special offer; a Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew jug and two
limited edition coffees for 29GBP*. Unfortunately the design of the email and
confirmation pages were confusing, and a few of you were rightly annoyed. Some
even ordered hardware without realising they had done so. I just wanted to
explain what happened, why, and what weâ€™re doing to avoid the same mistakes
going forward.

**Great digital experience**

As our longest-standing customers will attest, we spend a lot of time making
world-class, Direct Trade coffees easily available. In fact weâ€™re constantly
thinking of new ways to make getting your morning coffee as convenient and
flexible as possible. A big part of this is our digital user experience, which
I push to be as delightful and frictionless as possible.

**Single-click for the win (or so I thoughtâ€¦)**

To date weâ€™ve introduced some new features which weâ€™re pleased to say have
gone down really well. For example, we recently added the options to skip,
double up or change your coffee order straight from the â€˜shipping soonâ€™ emails
in a single click. We love this functionality, and the feedback from you guys
has been fantastic.

Buoyed by this success I pushed our product team for single-click purchases
from email too and the cold-brew promotion was our first test. This time the
feedback was largely negative; itâ€™s the norm to see a confirmation page before
committing to an online purchase, and thatâ€™s what you were expecting from us
too. Whilst you could subsequently cancel the order from the confirmation
page, this was missed by a number of customers (for example when the page
failed to load).

**So, what have we done?**

  * Naturally, the few people who ordered the bundle unintentionally havenâ€™t been charged and their bundles have been returned at our expense.
  * Weâ€™re adding a confirmation step to future emails of this kind.
  * Personally I still love the idea of an additional â€˜buy with 1-clickâ€™ option, but Iâ€™ll take a lead from our product team, and will do extensive user testing before itâ€™s considered.
  * I wrote this blog post, explaining what happened and why!

**My plea to you**

[Pact is on a mission to make coffee a force for
good](https://media.pactcoffee.com/files/Pact_Social_Impact_Report_2016.pdf),
by helping the world upgrade from shitty supermarket coffee and all the misery
it brings with it to both our kitchens, and the fields that produce it. Weâ€™re
taking on some vast companies â€“ both coffee brands and retailers â€“ who have
eye-watering resources to protect their position.

The only weapons we have in our arsenal are nimbleness, and our relationship
with you, our community. You can tell us what would improve your Pact
experience, and we can act on it quickly. So please, please, keep your
feedback coming. Challenge us to do better, share your amazing suggestions and
if you have any questions then reach out. We donâ€™t stand a chance without you.

Sincerely,

Stephen,

Founder â€“ Pact Coffee
