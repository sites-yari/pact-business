title: Why we roast the way we do
---

We often receive this question from our customers: “Why are our coffee beans
so light, shouldn’t they be darker?”

The answer: **We deliberately roast our beans lighter than the industry
average.**

Why do we do that?  
What does it mean for the strength of our coffee?  
And what does all this have to do with toast?

Those are three questions we’re going to answer. Right here, right now.

**We roast our coffee lighter.** **  
** We do this to retain the individuality of our coffees. When we say
‘individuality’ we mean the more subtle flavours that can be both revealed and
also hidden by the roasting process. These flavours tend to fall into one of
three categories:

  * **Natural flavours** : the floral or citrusy notes, that emerge when the coffee is grown and then processed.
  * **Light roasting flavours:** typically chocolatey and nutty, which emerge when the coffee is lightly roasted.
  * **Heavy roasting flavours:** the smoky or spicy flavours that develop from a heavy roasting.

As you can probably imagine, the latter two of these cannot be squeezed into
the same coffee bean. It’s a bit like with toast…

beans (they’re the ones on the right) to bring out their unique flavours

**The Toast Analogy  
** Roasting coffee is very similar to toasting bread. For most people, the
perfect piece of toast is a nice golden brown colour – not too pale, not too
dark. With a cracking piece of toast like that, the natural flavours of the
bread are complemented by a lovely sweetness because the bread has actually
been slightly caramelised. If you burn your toast, all you can really taste is
the burnt, charred bit. Some people like that, but for most a piece of burnt
toast is a tragic story of what could have been.

**Back to coffee…** **  
** Just like the toaster, the roaster faces two options:

1\. They can choose to heavily roast the beans, replacing their natural
flavours with smoky or spicy notes. This is generally how supermarket or high
street chain coffee is roasted. They opt for a dark, oily bean that is easy to
reproduce, making sure the coffee tastes the same whatever international
branch you happen to find yourself in…

2\. They can lightly roast their beans, like we do at Pact. This maintains the
natural flavours of the coffee, while adding some lovely light roast notes too
– producing the matt, lighter coloured bean.

So that’s what we do and why we do it. Sometimes we get emails from customers
asking about this so, hopefully, this post has been helpful. If it’s raised
any further questions then feel free to comment below or email
