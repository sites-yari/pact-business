A cafetiere can be an affectionate, loyal companion for years to come if
treated with love and respect. If you’re doing any of the following then you
need to check yourself, because mistreating an inanimate piece of kitchen
equipment is not big and not clever.

  1. **You’re scalding it!**

After your kettle has boiled, let the water cool for a minute before pouring
it in. As well as scorching the coffee, boiling water is known to make
cafetieres squeal and – in the most extreme cases – cry.

  2. **You’re rushing it!**

Allow the cafetiere to do its brewing thing for four minutes. That’s the
amount of time the little guy needs to deliver the best flavour, any less and
it’ll feel harassed and humiliated.

  3. **You’re shaming it!**

Before plunging, use two spoons to scoop off any grounds that are floating on
the top. These grounds can compromise the taste of the coffee, making the
cafetiere feel worthless.

cafetiere could be as happy as this one.
