As some of you may know, from coming along to our Pact tasting events, we’ve
recently moved offices. We’re still at the Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey but
we’re now in slightly bigger digs, and it’s all thanks to our (relatively) new
office manager, lovely Laura!

Laura’s high-flying past involves circus work, as in proper acrobatics and
stuff. As such there are a few exhillarating touches to the Pact HQ office
decor now. As you can see from the picture below, we now have three acrobatic
silks hanging by the central meeting space, which can either be used for
casual swinging or full on tricks…

So, let’s meet the lady behind the splits (only slightly hindered by her work
trousers) with a quick Pact Q&A session…

**What do you do at Pact?**  
Offfice manager/ HR

**What’s your favourite part of the working day (please don’t say home time)?  
** When Rob (our numbers guy) tries to make coffee. Lol.

**Tell us a bit about where you worked previously?**  
My last job was at a kiwi-run construction company. My role basically involved
bossing about big burly men.

**What is it about Pact that made you want to work here?**  
It reminds me of my time in the circus. Seriously.

**What’s your preferred brew method?**  
When Stephen or Pete make it for me.

**What does your favourite mug look like?**  
See picture. It is important that the mug is obeyed at all times.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**  
Anything by a redneck.

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**  
Not enough coffee.
