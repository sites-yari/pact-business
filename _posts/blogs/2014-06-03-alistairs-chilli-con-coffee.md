![Alistair Willoughby](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/alistair-
willoughby.jpeg?w=300)Meet our chilli con coffee hero, Alistair.

I can’t take credit for this recipe. I know it’s tasty, and as much as I want
to say it was all me, I had some help. So when you’re chowing down on this
insanely delish take on a Mexican classic, you can actually thank
[Alistair](https://twitter.com/Ali_Willoughby).

Alistair is one of our many fabulous Pact customers and he got in touch with
his recipe for Chilli Con Coffee. Well, as you may have guessed, it’s a total
winner. Maybe it’s because Mexico is one of the world’s top coffee producers,
but it seems like all these flavours were made for each other.

If you’re like Alistair and you love cooking with coffee, why not let us know?

**Method  
** 1\. Brown mince in a pan over medium heat with a dash of olive oil. Once
cooked, remove from the pan.  
2\. Heat pan once again with another dash of olive oil and add onions, garlic,
chillies, pepper, carrot and celery. You want the mix to be soft and fragrant,
try to avoid browning the vegetables.  
3\. Next add the spices (chilli powder/flakes, cumin, black pepper, oregano,
paprika) as well as the stock cube, Worcestershire sauce, coffee and Tabasco.  
4\. Fry for 5 minutes, stirring well.  
5\. Stir in the mince from earlier and the tomato paste. Turn heat to low,
allowing mixture to simmer for 30 minutes. Stir periodically. If chilli looks
a bit dry, add a dash of water and continue to stir.  
6\. Serve on a bed of rice with a few sprigs of coriander.

**PACT TIP** : If you’re looking to bulk your chilli up why not add kidney or
black beans? Vegetarians could even try substituting beef with a mix of beans
and chickpeas.
