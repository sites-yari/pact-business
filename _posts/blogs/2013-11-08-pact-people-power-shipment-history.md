title: 'Pact People Power: Shipment History'

About a month ago, we launched our [Pact Feedback
Forum](http://support.pactcoffee.com/), where we encourage you to ‘spill the
beans’ on ways you’d like us to improve the Pact service. Well, you spoke and
we listened and as a result we’ve got something exciting to share with you
today…

**Shipment History!**

It has been the most popular idea on UserVoice, so we hope you find it useful.
On the order history page, you’ll see your last 5 shipments (for now) with
some tasting notes and buttons to rate your coffees.

Take a look on your [account page here.](http://www.pactcoffee.com/account)

This is only version 1, and we’re going to be improving on it over the coming
weeks. If you’ve got any ideas of improvements you’d like to see in the next
version, add your voice to [this page
here!](http://support.pactcoffee.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-
feedback/suggestions/4456371-visible-order-history)

Thank you to all of the voters that helped to make [this
idea](http://support.pactcoffee.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-
feedback/suggestions/4456371-visible-order-history) a reality. If you’ve got a
suggestion for how we can make Pact even better, we’d love to hear about it…
