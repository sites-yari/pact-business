Last week something really brilliant happened.

One of our Pact customers, @helendaykin came up with the idea of having a
‘virtual coffee’ with a couple of her Twitter pals ([Mary
Farmer](https://twitter.com/ebd35) and [Chris
Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/chrisrat)). Here’s how it went down (thanks
Helen for tagging us so we could see what you were up to):

“Wow.” we thought “What a neat way to indulge in a coffee. And how cool to use
Twitter to enjoy your coffee with fellow coffee-lovers.”

In fact we thought it was so neat that we’ve been following in their
footsteps. For the last week or so we’ve been enjoying our own 10am coffee at
Pact HQ. Why 10am? Because, as Helen puts it “5:30am is emergency coffee then
10am is coffee to savour!”

[So next time it’s 10am and you’re in the mood for a cuppa, why not take five
minutes to join us for a virtual coffee on Twitter? Show us how your brew has
gone, let us know what you’re drinking or pitch in with some full on tasting
notes!](https://twitter.com/chrisrat)
