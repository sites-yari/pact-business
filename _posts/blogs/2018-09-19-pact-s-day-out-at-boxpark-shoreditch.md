As much as some globe-conquering fast food companies would have you believe - in a series of admittedly clever adverts about flat whites - speciality coffee isn’t _just_ for hipsters. You don’t need a twirly moustache and a fixie bike, you don’t have to drink it out of a jam jar in a converted shed in Hackney. Yeah, you don’t _have_ to be a hipster… but you can be. And that’s why we brought our first Pact Coffee for Business pop-up to Shoreditch (we're kidding... sort of).

Pact bundled up some coffee, machines, cups, little wooden stirrers and its merry band of sales executives, heading down to Boxpark Shoreditch to share its wares. Getting up at 3am to brew mega batches of our finest coffee and setting up for a 6am start, our team hung around for _both_ rush hours - only retreating after 7pm. Phew. But why did we do it?

To spread the word about speciality, of course - in the office, or at home! We came armed with 1000 coffee bag samples to hand out (even Paul, our MD, got involved!) and 100 litres of the hot stuff to fuel the weary masses as they tumbled out of Shoreditch High Street station. We met with existing clients, reached out to new potential customers and overall? We think we made quite a buzz… even if it was just all that caffeine.
