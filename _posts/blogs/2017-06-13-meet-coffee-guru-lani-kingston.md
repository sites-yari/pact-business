A couple of weeks ago we were thrilled to have Lani Kingston, author and
coffee guru, come and visit us at our Bermondsey HQ. She was keen to learn
more about Pact for a new book she’s writing about the London coffee scene and
we were intrigued to find out more about her upcoming project. Here’s how it
went down…

**Pact: So what are you working on?**

**Lani:** It’s called _London Coffee._ It’s telling the story of London coffee
as a whole rather than being a guide book. I wanted to get a little bit
deeper, tell more of the history, the types of companies that are making their
mark on the scene, and hopefully where coffee will grow from here…The London
coffee scene is very vibrant and very diverse as well. While there are lots of
amazing coffee cities in the world at the moment, I think London with its
combination of cultural diversity and technology and other inputs has created
this incredible and innovative scene.

**Pact: Do you see Pact as part of that?**

**Lani:** Yes…I think Pact is an exceptionally interesting company. Pact has
done a great job of connecting future technology with a passion for
handcrafted, well-made, quality, coffee. I was saying to Will (Pact’s Head of
Coffee) before… it is really interesting to me how Pact, I think, connects
that convenience, which lot of people want, with the quality that people have
now come to expect – so it’s an excellent example of how coffee can move
forward into the future.

**Pact: Do you think there’s still a bit of a barrier to getting more people
to drink speciality coffee?**

**Lani:** I think there has been in the past…That accessibility is quite
difficult, I think, when you are dealing with what has been seen as a niche
product. But the way that Pact has shown an openness to providing ‘ready to
go’ coffee has broken that down. Many roasters will only sell whole bean, but
the fact that you will provide grind sizes in whatever people like definitely
brings that barrier down. Coffee certainly shouldn’t be scary. You can get
into coffee as much as you want or you can just enjoy your morning cup of
coffee.

**Pact: Can a company like Pact like take on the coffee ‘big boys’ that
dominate the coffee market?**

**Lani:** Definitely! There is only a small part of the coffee crop that can
be classed as speciality coffee and you do have to find a buyer for the whole
crop so there’ll always be a place for everyone. But…bringing speciality
coffee to a larger audience and making it more accessible is something that
everyone should be working towards. Pact has the potential to bring speciality
coffee to anyone in the world with the model you’ve set up here. The
interesting thing to me is how you work with the customer’s preferences.

than telling them what they should drink” Lani Kingston

**Pact: Tell us a bit more about your upcoming book…**

**Lani:** It’ll be out in October this year. It’s being released by [Hoxton
Mini Press](https://www.hoxtonminipress.com/), a publisher that makes these
beautiful cloth-bound, high quality books. I selected them because they are
known for books that basically provide a cultural snapshot. They document a
moment in time and this time in the coffee scene is really interesting. We’re
at the peak of this 40 year rise since Monmouth started so it’s a great time
to be releasing a book like this.

**Pact: So it’ll be a coffee table book about coffee?**

**Lani:** (laughing) That’s right…

**Pact: We look forward to seeing _London Coffee_ when it comes (out and
reading about Pact’s role in coffee in our home city). Thanks for chatting
with us, Lani!**
