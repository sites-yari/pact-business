Who needs Valentines when you have cake?

Coffee & Date Loaf

**Ingredients**

  * 110g ready-to-eat dates, chopped
  * 50ml of [Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/)
  * 100g caster sugar
  * 50g soft margarine
  * 2 medium eggs, beaten
  * 150g self-raising flour
  * 1 teaspoon of baking powder

**Method**

  1. Pop the chopped dates into a large bowl along with the Pact Coffee and leave them to soak
  2. Grease and line a 1lb loaf tin with baking parchment and preheat your oven to 160°C
  3. Beat the dates and coffee together to make a thick paste
  4. Add all the other ingredients to the date and coffee paste and mix thoroughly
  5. Pour this mixture into your prepared tin and bake for 40-50 minutes until well-risen and golden
  6. Insert a skewer into the cake and ensure it comes out clean before fully removing the loaf from the oven
  7. Leave the loaf to cool and serve with cups of piping hot Pact Coffee

**Pact tip:** For added prettiness decorate your loaf with flaked almonds,
which complement the flavour of the loaf really well.
