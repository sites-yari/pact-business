to make you dribble…ahem… drool.

This year Tuesday the 17th of February is an exciting day, and not just
because it’s Michael Jordan’s 51st birthday. That’s right, it’s that most
delicious of all the breakfast-based holidays: Pancake Day (otherwise known as
Shrove Tuesday). For some people it’s the last chance to indulge before the
start of Lent and for others it’s a good excuse to eat pancakes mid-week.

Whichever camp you fall into, this recipe for **[Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/?utm_source=GD&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=pancakerecipe&utm_campaign=20150204blog)** Pancakes is a hole-
in-one. It’s also a slam dunk for Michael Jordan fans who feel like
celebrating the sporting legend’s birthday with a tasty breakfast treat.

In case you need more reasons to whip up a batch, these pancakes can be
topped/embellished with any ingredients you think will taste great with
coffee. They’re designed to be delightful and indulgent, so why not add some
chocolate chips or flaked nuts to the mixture?

**Ingredients  
** 120g flour  
2 tbsp sugar  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/4 tsp salt  
240 ml buttermilk (give it a shake)  
1 large egg  
2 shots strong **[Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/?utm_source=GD&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=pancakerecipe&utm_campaign=20150204blog)**  
1 tbsp unsalted butter.

**Method**

  1. Melt butter in the microwave and allow to cool.
  2. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt).
  3. In a separate (smaller) bowl beat the egg, then add to this the buttermilk, coffee and butter.
  4. Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture is well-combined, but still slightly lumpy.
  5. Heat a non-stick fry pan, and spray with oil. Once it’s hot, use a tablespoon to measure out batter on the pan.
  6. Leave each pancake to cook for about 2-3 minutes before flipping.
  7. Serve warm with a topping of your choice. Some pretty tasty additions include butter, maple syrup or chocolate sauce.
