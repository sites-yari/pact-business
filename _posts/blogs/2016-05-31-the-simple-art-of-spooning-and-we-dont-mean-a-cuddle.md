action

Although cafetieres seem to be one of the most popular ways to brew coffee,
we’ve found that some drinkers mistreat these little guys without even knowing
it.

In ‘[Three ways you’re mistreating your
cafetiere…](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/06/three-ways-youre-abusing-
your-cafetiere-and-you-dont-even-know-it/)’, we included some handy tips to
get the most out of your cafetiere, including using two spoons to scoop off
any grounds that may be floating on top. This is called the ‘crust’ and can
make a difference in the amount of sediment that’s left at the bottom of your
cup.

However, as one customer rightly asked – hey, Andy! – why would we use two
spoons instead of one? Is there some sort of technique when it comes to
scooping coffee crust?

The answer is yes, but it’s not too tricky. Here, we’ve made a little video to
help you perfect the art of the two spoon technique.
