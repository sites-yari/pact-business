You know how much [we love cycling](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/08/28/two-
wheels-good-four-wheels-bad/ "Two wheels good. Four wheels bad."), and [we’re
always up for helping a worthy
cause](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/09/09/macmillan-coffee-morning-with-
pact/ "Macmillan Coffee Morning with Pact"), so when ITV announced that their
annual [Text Santa](http://itvresponsibility.com/our-reach/on-
air/archive/text-santa/) charity fundraiser was a 24 hour static cycle, we
couldn’t help but get involved.

And what can we say… a whole day and night with Phillip Schofield really
sealed the deal.

So, on Monday, December 1st, the Pact Team will be at the ITV studios
pedalling with all our might for a full 24 hours to help some incredible UK
charities. We’re hoping to raise thousands of pounds, and with your help we
might just make that happen. There are two ways to get involved:

1\. You can donate via our [**JustGiving**](https://www.justgiving.com/Pact-
Coffee) page.  
2\. You can get on your bike… well, our bike, really.

**Fancy Meeting Phillip?  
** We’ve put a team together, but we could always do with a little more
manpower. So if you’d like to be a part of Team Pact, we’d welcome the extra
sets of legs with open arms.

Email [ahoy@pactcoffee.com](mailto:ahoy@pactcoffee.com) to get involved – you
may even get to meet Phillip Schofield.

**A little bit about Text Santa.  
** Since it started in 2011, Text Santa has managed to raise £15m and greater
awareness for UK charities. All the money this year will be split between
Teenage Cancer Trust, Guide Dogs, WellChild, Marie Curie Cancer Care,
Alzheimer’s Society and Together for Short Lives. These charities all have
vital projects in communities across the UK, which desperately need funding.
Money raised will transform the lives of so many people who are reliant on
support from these organisations.
