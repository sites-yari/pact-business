**In Italian, ‘affogato’ means ‘drowned’ – which, when you read the recipe,
makes perfect sense – to be honest, though, we’re not really bothered what the
name means, we’re just grateful they exist at all. And why wouldn’t we? It’s
coffee. With ice cream. Need we say more?**

In all seriousness, we love affogatos. They’re perfect for when you need to
serve up an incredibly tasty dessert in a pinch. Here’s how to do it:

**Method**

  * You’ll need Pact Coffee, a scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream and some amaretto biscuits.
  * Brew a shot of strong coffee (traditionally you’d use espresso, but a stovetop, Aeropress or cafetiere, when brewed strong enough will work a treat too).
  * Scoop the ice cream into coffee cups or small bowls and then ‘drown’ in coffee.
  * Crumble up the amaretto biscuits and sprinkle over the top.

That’s it. It’s the simple things in life, isn’t it.
