title: Fresh Uses For Stale Grounds
---

We take freshness pretty seriously here at Pact HQ, that’s why we make it our
business to grind your coffee within a week of it being roasted. The reason
for this is simply that fresh coffee tastes better. Old coffee, on the other
hand, lacks the complex flavours and body you get with fresh beans.

So, once you’ve tried Pact Coffee that supermarket stuff you’ve got knocking
around probably won’t get a look in. Stale grounds aren’t all bad though.
We’ve found some great ways to make sure your old, unwanted coffee doesn’t go
to waste. That way, you can save your fresh coffee for your cup.

grounds make a luxurious face and body scrub.

**Scrubbing Up  
** I’ve read about celebrities who extol the virtues of coffee grounds as a
remedy for cellulite. I certainly won’t pretend to know anything about that,
but I will say that grounds make a great body wash.

Simply rinse stale coffee and combine with liquid soap to enjoy an
invigorating daily scrub. You’ll feel refreshed and smell fantastic.

ask Junta, he swears by it!

**Neutralising Odours  
** Have you ever wondered why perfume departments are littered with little
bowls of coffee beans? Well, it’s because coffee makes a great neutraliser for
odours. A little whiff of those fragrant beans will cleanse your sense of
smell, preparing it for the next scent.

To put this theory to work in your home, place an open bowl of beans or
grounds in your refrigerator. The sweet smell of coffee will break down any
residual food odours, freshening even the most sharehouse-y of fridges.

**Cooking With Coffee  
** Have you caught any of our [coffee-inspired recipes on the Pact
blog](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/coffee-academy/cooking-with-coffee-
coffee-academy/)? Whether you’ve cooked with coffee or not, there’s no denying
that it’s a fun ingredient to experiment with. It’s also a great opportunity
to use those old grounds you’ve got lying around.

As coffee is most commonly added to sweets – it does go well with chocolate,
doesn’t it? – many are surprised at how well coffee complements savoury dishes
too. Brew old grounds and add the coffee to a pot of chilli con carne, or slow
roasted pork. It’s especially great in a [barbecue
marinade](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/04/25/pact-thai-bbq-chicken/ "Pact
Thai BBQ Chicken").

**Furniture Fixes  
** Wooden furniture not looking as good as it used to? Scratches are a common
result of general wear and tear, but luckily they’re easy enough to fix with
some help from your favourite beans.

Mix your old grounds with some warm water and dab onto any damaged areas.
Leave it for a little while before wiping clean. The colour of the coffee will
stain the raw surfaces, minimising the appearance of scratches.

**Go Green  
** Are your plants looking a bit sad? Your garden might need a little nitrogen
boost. Nitrogen is necessary for ensuring your greens are lush and leafy, and
coffee grounds make a great soil supplement.

After soaking and rinsing your stale grinds (you can also use the leftovers
from your kit too – did you know paper filters are compostable?), blend them
with your soil or compost. You can also mix a handful grounds in your watering
can for a further boost.

** So now you know our ideas, it’s time to hear yours! Have you found any new
uses for stale supermarket grounds? Comment below with your own handy hints.
