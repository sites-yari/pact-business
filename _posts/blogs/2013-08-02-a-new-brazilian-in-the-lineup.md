title: A new Brazilian in the lineup
---

Have you heard about the hot new Brazilian everyone’s talking about? No, we
don’t mean Neymar (in fact we know very little about football). We’re actually
referring to Fazenda Lagoa, which just happens to be our latest headline-
grabbing signing. It’s a smooth, rich coffee that will have you chanting from
the terraces and painting your face in Brazil’s national colours. So, what are
its vital statistics?

  
**It hails from a coffee heartland**

The Fazenda Lagoa plantation can be found in Sul de Minas, the coffee
heartland of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The name Fazenda Lagoa is
Portuguese and can be translated as ‘Lake Farm’, which paints a pretty picture
of a coffee utopia, don’t you think? Grown at between 950 and 1,200 metres
above sea-level this coffee appreciates a plantation with a view – and what a
view.

**It benefits from over 100 years of expertise**

The farm is owned and managed by Marcelo Vieira, whose great grandfather
established his first plantation here on the slopes of Serra do Pau D’Alho
over 100 years ago. In fact the original farmhouse still stands, boasting a
wide veranda and a picture-perfect courtyard surrounded by Jabuticaba trees.
Jam enthusiasts may also be interested to know that the fruit from those
Jabuticaba trees is used to make the farm’s own lip-smacking jam.

But we digress.

**It comes from people who know their beans**

These days Fazenda Lagoa combines a rich coffee growing tradition with
thoroughly modern processing facilities and farming techniques. The plantation
has around 400 hectares dedicated to growing coffee, with lots carefully
separated into different varietals. Fazenda Lagoa grows Acaiá, Bourbon,
Catuaí, and of course this bean – the magnificent Mundo Novo.

The farm also contains some 600 hectares of forest reserves, which provide a
habitat for the hundreds of different native bird species found in the area.
Yup, we’re talking a coffee utopia.
