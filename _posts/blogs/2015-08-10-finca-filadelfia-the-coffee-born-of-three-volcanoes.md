You might be wondering, while you enjoy your Pact Coffee, about its homeland,
and those who grew it. Wonder no more! The latest addition to [our coffee
menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees),
[Filadelfia](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/finca-filadelfia), is one of
Will’s (our Head of Coffee) favourites. Here’s why:

> Super tasty coffee. There are plenty of juicy pineapple, orange and ripe
tropical fruit flavours which match beautifully with the juicy mouthfeel and
syrupy sweetness. With all of the intense sweetness, acidity, mouthfeel and
flavour it should be a real punch around the face but in fact it’s elegant and
smooth.

It’s grown in the coffee region of Antigua, which spreads across a valley
surrounded by three volcanoes, Agua (Water), Acatenango, and Fuego (Fire). The
Fuego volcano, which means fire in Spanish, is still under constant eruption,
clouds of smoke are regularly visible above its peak. The coffee grown in
Antigua is enriched by the volcanic soil which is full of nutrients and
retains the water needed for the cherries to develop well.

This year (2015), tragedy struck: the Volcan de Fuego erupted a serious amount
of ash impacting coffee across various regions, including Antigua. Fortunately
winds blew the ash from the plants which prevented any long term damage to the
trees, although volcanic soil is important to the high quality of coffee in
the area, ash sitting on the leaves of the trees will kill it.

The main town in the region is called Antigua. It is a cultural center for
tourism as it is the ancient capital of both the Mayans and the country of
Guatemala. The increase in tourism has attracted a lot of locals and
foreigners to live in the town. The demographic pressures create a demand for
property in the region: Farmers are enticed with lucrative property value
offers to sell their land, making it harder and harder to find coffee from
there. Thankfully, there’s still great coffee to be had, and Filadelfia is one
of the best!

The proud farmer of Filadelfia coffee, Francis Doulton, owns the highest farm
in the region (a staggering 1650M above sea level). This and his constant
quest for quality are at the heart of why his coffee stands above so many
others. We’re proud to offer his coffee in our roster.
