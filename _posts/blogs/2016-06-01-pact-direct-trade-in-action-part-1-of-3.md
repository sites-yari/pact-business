## Phase 1: Building a relationship

**Transcribed from a chat with Will, our Head of Coffee.**

At Pact, we have the goal of making coffee a force for good and changing
millions of people’s lives. The building blocks for that lie in working with
small coffee producers who share our vision of producing a fantastic quality
product and have the drive to do it.

Our **3 Phase Program** is how we structure our work with producers:

**Phase 1 – Building a relationship.  
Phase 2 – Upgrading their kit.  
Phase 3 – Helping them grow.**

It all starts off by identifying those producers that have the basic
requirements in their land and their technical ability to produce good quality
coffee. From that lot we find the people who genuinely want to produce a high
quality coffee.

By identifying and working with those motivated producers they become an
example for everyone else by showing that hard work can pay off and they can
be earning great money for producing a great product and be very proud in
doing so. Through all the phases we work with local experts. We are not
walking around these farms making suggestions thinking we know more about
coffee production and the region than people who have been doing this for
generations. We work very closely with those who understand the techniques
that are best. It would be crazy to not utilize this expertise.

## Phase 1 in action…

Over a week long period in Colombia, I tried around 200 cups of coffee from
many different farms and producers. What I’m looking for is taste and flavours
in the cup that show the promise of being great quality, but also the efforts
of the producers to grow high quality coffee. When I find a cup I like we then
buy small lots of that coffee to test it in London, usually about 700kg from a
farm that could produce 7 tons. It’s a risk for them because it costs more to
produce high quality specialty coffee than commodity grade coffee (what you’d
find in the supermarkets). But knowing that they can make a couple of thousand
dollars more on that small batch makes it worth the risk.

Identifying the producers with the most potential is the first step. Once we
find them we then look at the farm itself, the production, and the processing
methods. When the coffee arrives at Pact HQ we do further analysis of the
moisture content and longevity of the beans. From all that information we can
put together a picture of what’s happening on the farm and of any small
changes we can suggest to improve quality.

literally, to determine quality through size.

We may advise them to, for example, dry the coffee a little bit slower, pick
more ripe cherries, or try to pick the cherries before they become overripe.
These small tips can dramatically increase the quality of the coffee produced.

After the education stage, we buy another crop and check whether the quality
has improved. It usually has. For coffee that is already in the 80+ specialty
range, improving their score ([learn more about Coffee Quality Scores
here](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/06/06/how-good-is-our-coffee-really-
quality-scores-explained/)) by a quarter or half a point is massive. This
improvement in score shows commitment to producing high quality coffee and
commitment to the relationship they want to have with Pact and our community
of coffee lovers.
