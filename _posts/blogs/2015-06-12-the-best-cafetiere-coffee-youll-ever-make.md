title: "The Best Cafetiere Coffee You\u2019ll Ever Make"
---

The cafetière, or french press, is a great way of making coffee to share, or
if you fancy a couple of cups all to yourself! Here’s how we brew using a
cafetière. This method is very adaptable, so don’t hesitate to add more water
if it’s too strong, or more coffee if it’s too weak!

Put your kettle on to the boil with as many cupfuls of water as you’ll need.
You can use your own cups as measures. We recommend using the full volume of
the cafetière for the best results.

Add a scoop or a heaped tablespoon of coffee per person to the cafetière and
wait for the water.

**Let the water settle off the boil for one minute, then pour into the
cafetière.** Fill it to the top, then give the grounds a good stir.

Start a timer for 4 minutes. Any timer will do, we usually have our phones on
us anyway so we use them.

special move.

**Lastly, scoop off the floating grounds from the top of the cafetière with
two spoons.** This is a trick that most brewers neglect. It comes from the
coffee sourcing world, and it removes all hindrances to the taste. Place those
grounds in a cup or into the bin.

Press it down slowly and evenly, then serve to your amazed and delighted
guests. Enjoy.
