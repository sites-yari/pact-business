So, day 1 of 2016 and you’re feeling a bit worse for wear. You might feel that
hope is lost and you’ll be feeling this way all day, and maybe tomorrow too,
but help is at hand! On your way to your kitchen, pass by your medicine
cabinet and grab some aspirin, we’ve got some hangovers to cure.

The latest research, as reported in the Times, says that the _“caffeine in
coffee and the anti-inflammatory ingredients of aspirin and other painkillers
reacted against the chemical compounds of ethanol, or pure alcohol”,_
lessening the effect of festive excess!

This has only really been tested on rats, but Prof Oshinsky was quick to point
out to the journal New Scientist that “ _none of the commonly cited causes of
hangovers could have caused this response_ “.

So hooray! We have a solution, and a cheap one at that. We’re sure it works
wonders alongside a full english breakfast…
