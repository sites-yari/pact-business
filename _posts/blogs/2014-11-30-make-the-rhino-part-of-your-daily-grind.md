[![RhinoEmail2](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/rhinoemail2.jpg)](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/rhinoemail2.jpg)Have
you been thinking about ramping up your coffee’s freshness factor? We make
sure it’s fresh by grinding it at the last minute, but having your own grinder
can really take it to the next level.

Enter: The Rhino Grinder.

This crazy-good bit of kit, allows you to hand grind the necessary amount of
coffee as and when you need it. Our coffee guy, Will, swears by it, and he’s
not the only one. It’s an incredibly popular piece of equipment with just
about everyone in the business. That’s why we think you deserve one. **For
free.**

**Throughout December, when you get 5 friends to sign up for a £1 bag of Pact
Coffee, we’ll send you your very own Rhino Grinder, valued at £35.**

To make things even easier, we’ve set up a simple and speedy way to get your
pals on board:

  1. Simply [login to your **Pact Account Page**](https://www.pactcoffee.com/login?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=account&utm_content=viralgrinder)
  2. Share your personal invitation code.

And don’t worry, we’ll help you keep track of your referrals along the way. So
all you need to do is get sharing.
