**Whatâ€™s your name and Twitter handle?**

Stephen Rapoport, [@stephenrapoport](http://www.twitter.com/stephenrapoport)

**How long have you been with Pact?**

Since October 2012, when I started the business out of my kitchen in Balham,
SW London.

**Whatâ€™s your favourite brew method?**

It varies a lot. I tend to make a cafetiere every morning for me and Emma to
share. Then itâ€™s v60 at work. Oh, and on weekends I make a mean flat white on
my Europiccola.

**Whatâ€™s your favourite time of day to make a coffee, and why?**

First thing in the morning. The smell and sound of the beans grinding ease me
into the day almost as much as the coffee itself!

**Who introduced you to coffee?**

I probably had my first cup of coffee when I was 15, working in a chocolate
warehouse. (It was Nescafe). I think I first discovered fresh roasted coffee
at Monmouth in Soho about 10 years ago.

**On what day does your coffee taste best, and why?**

Sunday. I think because itâ€™s the day I get to indulge most in the process of
making it.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**

Ooh tough one. Maybe [Frank Sinatra Ring-a-Ding-
Ding](https://play.spotify.com/album/5OEf5Cpd68iTlv8MraQGID)? It features The
Coffee Song ðŸ™‚

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**

What problem CANâ€™T be solved with coffee!?

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**

Coffee gives me all the power I need!

**Thank you Stephen for sharing your coffee rituals! if youâ€™d like to be
