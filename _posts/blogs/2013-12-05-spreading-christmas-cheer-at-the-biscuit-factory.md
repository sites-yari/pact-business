title: Spreading Christmas Cheer at The Biscuit Factory
---

Yesterday at Pact HQ we were participating in our local Christmas fair. We
spent the afternoon down at the Bermondsey Biscuit Factory, spreading the word
about Pact. Everyone was super pleased to receive their gifts early this year,
with ‘Captain Pugwash’ helping us share them with the Lolloping landlubbers.

If you’d like to spread some festive cheer, why not send your loved ones the
gift of great tasting coffee.[ Take a look at our gifting page
