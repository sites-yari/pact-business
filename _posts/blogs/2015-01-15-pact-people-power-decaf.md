We’re normally of the opinion that coffee should be about pleasure over
politics. But sometimes the people stand up for what they want in a coffee,
and any self-respecting coffee company needs to take notice. And act.

That’s what happened with our new Decaf.

For a while now we’ve been collecting your game-changing ideas for how to
improve Pact. How? Via **[Pact People
Power](http://pactcoffee.uservoice.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-
feedback?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=peoplepower&utm_campaign=20150115blog)**. And for a while
you’ve been requesting a decaf option to be added to the [**Pact Coffee
Menu.**](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) The reasons have ranged from
babies to bedtime coffee drinking, but reasons aside there were enough of you
requesting it that we knew we had to do something about it.

So in December, [Will (our Head of
Coffee)](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/16/introducing-will/ "Introducing
Will…") settled upon a decaf coffee that he thought was good enough to add to
the Pact Coffee Menu. We only placed a small order and didn’t make any
promises about how long it would be around because we didn’t know how it would
go down.

Well, here’s how it went down:

So it looks like Decaf will be sticking around for a while. You can get hold
