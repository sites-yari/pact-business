title: Why Mugs Matter
---

**What does your favourite mug look like? Is it sleek and modern, well-worn
and sentimentally potent or perhaps practical and portable? Psychologists and
academic-types agree that the design and colour of your mug can make really
great coffee even more enjoyable. So your choice of coffee receptacle really
is important. Read on to find out why…**

**First of all – why the cup matters.**

If you’re drinking a top class cup of coffee – like the type we deliver, say –
then doesn’t the coffee itself do all the talking? A specific cup, with
sentimental or ‘quality’ attachments isn’t going to make any difference to the
experience of drinking. Is it?

According to the marketing academic Aradhna Krishna, the answer is ‘yes, it
is’.

She argues in her book ‘Customer Sense’ that we enjoy something more when it
is presented in a more pleasing manner. Apparently our brains – the
orbitofrontal cortex to be precise – combine all sensory inputs into one
overall evaluation. So it really is worth making sure you drink from a mug
that you’re either emotionally attached to or aesthetically pleased by.

Still in doubt? Think about how you’d feel about drinking Pact Coffee from a
flimsy paper cup, versus something porcelain and perfectly formed from the
Scandinavian Design Centre.

**Secondly – why the colour matters.**

At the end of last year it was reported in the journal Flavour that the colour
of your coffee cup can have a psychological impact on the taste of your
coffee. The hypothesis was that a white mug enhances our perception of
bitterness.

To test the theory, volunteers compared coffee served in a white mug against a
transparent one. Despite being the same coffee, the white mug was found to
increase the perceived intensity. The researchers drew the conclusion that
this increased bitterness was probably enhanced by the contrast between the
colour of the mug and that of its contents.

So when choosing and building a relationship with a coffee cup, it’s important
to consider form and colour. But what other factors come into play? These Pact
