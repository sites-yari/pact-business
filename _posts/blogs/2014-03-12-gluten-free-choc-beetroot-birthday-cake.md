title: Gluten-free choc-beetroot birthday cake
---

Office birthdays are the best. Hands down. When your blood sugar gets low
around mid-afternoon (or mid-morning – we’re not judging!), it doesn’t matter
whose birthday it is, everyone’s in the mood for celebrating! And there’s no
better way to brighten up the workday than with a slice of cake and a cup of
coffee. Well, lucky for the Pact crew we had a double birthday this week, with
[Anneliese ](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/introducing-anneliese-and-
her-limited-edition-pact-tote-bags/ "Anneliese")and
[Em](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/10/find-out-whos-been-packing-your-
coffee/ "Em") sharing Monday’s celebrations.

Weirdly, both girls are gluten intolerant, so Anneliese served up a delicious
slice of gluten-free heaven! She gets extra points for not just baking her
_own_ birthday cake, but for sharing the recipe too.

So, in honour of Anneliese and Em – both a year older and (probably) a little
bit wiser – we invite you to join in the festivities with this super sweet,
gluten-free taste explosion!

Don’t think so!

**Ingredients  
** Cake  
225g gluten-free flour  
350g caster sugar  
85g cocoa powder  
1½ tsp gluten-free baking powder  
1½ tsp bicarbonate soda  
2 free range eggs  
250g beetroot in sweet vinegar (pureed)  
250ml milk  
125ml vegetable oil  
250ml boiling water

Filling **  
** 200ml double cream (whipped)  
A generous dash of beetroot/sweet vinegar juice from the jar

Icing **  
** 200g dark chocolate  
200ml double cream

**Method  
** 1\. Begin by preheating the oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and greasing two
sandwich tins. Puree the beetroot with a hand blender.

2\. Combine all the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large
mixing bowl and whisk until mixture is nice and smooth.

3\. Stir in the boiling water, adding a little bit at a time until your
mixture is very liquid and smooth.  
4\. Divide batter between the sandwich tins and bake for 25-35 mins, or until
the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out
clean.  
5\. Once cooked, remove the cakes from the oven and, keeping them in the tins,
allow them to cool completely.  
6\. While you wait prepare the icing by melting the chocolate and cream in a
saucepan over low heat. Remove from the stove and whisk until smooth.

7\. To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside edge of
the tins and ease the cakes out.  
8\. For the centre of your cake, whip the remaining cream and mix with some
juice from the beetroot jar to create a striking pinky-purple colour. Spread
this over the top of one cake, then carefully top with the second cake.  
9\. Transfer to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate
icing using a platter knife.
