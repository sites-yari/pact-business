Do you believe in soul mates? That everyone has a perfect match, that makes
life worth living, mornings worth waking up for and coffee more marvellous?

We do.

So when we asked you to **[tell us about your favourite
mugs](http://j.mp/1xRCW75)** , we weren’t surprised at the outpouring of
affection that followed. It seems that the **[Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=muglove&utm_campaign=20150204blog)** we send out is helping to
cement some very special relationships between human beings and their ceramic
counterparts.

from any other mug.

day (as opposed to 35% who drink from theirs daily)

all&utm_content=muglove&utm_campaign=20150204blog)** from their favourite mug.

**How long have you been together?  
** More than six blissful months.

**Where did you get it?  
** It was bought for me as a present by my lovely girlfriend when I started my
new job.

**What’s your favourite thing about it?  
** It has a dinosaur on it. Also, it says “Dinosaurs are cool!” on the other
side. That’s two things, but they go together, otherwise I would look weird
with just one of them on the mug.

**Does coffee taste better from this mug than any other?  
** Yes.

**Why is that?  
** The cup is made of bone china (what else would you make a cup with a
dinosaur on it out of?!?) and I think this definitely helps make my coffee
taste better.
