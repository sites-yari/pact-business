Tuesday (2nd December) Pact Coffee is going to be fuelling an invite-only
Evans Cycles event in Central London. Coffee, check. Cycling, check. And here
comes the doozie; Chris Hoy will be in attendance for an hour-long Q&A.
Olympic gold-medal-winning all-round cycle legend, check.

So why would we dangle this in front of you unless you had the chance to join
us? We wouldn’t.

To win one of five tickets for the event, which takes place at **6.30pm at
Evans Cycles on Mortimer Street** , simply tweet us a photo of your good self
enjoying a Pact Coffee in the saddle of your own two-wheeled steed – along
with the tag **#evanspactcoffee**

Will (our Head of Coffee and Chris Hoy’s #1 fan) will be choosing his
favourites at 4pm on Wednesday (26th November), so please do tweet your entry
by then…
