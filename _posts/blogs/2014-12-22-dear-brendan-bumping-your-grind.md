Dear Brendan,

I’m currently involved with a blade grinder. We’re doing ok together, even if
it doesn’t seem like it notices the difference between a coarse and fine
grind, I know it cares… deep down. Recently, however, I’ve found myself
wondering what my life would be like with a burr grinder. I’ve heard some
people say they’d never go back to their blade once they’ve switched. Should I
bump my grind?

Toby,

Hi Toby,

As much as I’d hate to come between a man and his blade grinder, the very fact
you’re writing to me about your doubts makes me think that yours isn’t a match
made in heaven.

Will, our Head of Coffee, is actually a massive burr grinder fan. The reason
for this is blade grinders aren’t great at grinding beans in a consistent way,
leaving coffee in a multitude of different sized grounds, which is bad for
your brew.

I’d never be one to break up a happy home but it could be that your current
grinder simply isn’t worthy of the coffee you’re sharing with it. It may be
hard to break things off in the short term, but in the end it could be best
for both of you.

Mugs and kisses,  
Brendan
