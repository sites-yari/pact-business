When we got to work producing our very own NespressoⓇ-compatible pods, our aim
was to give pod drinkers a better quality, great-tasting alternative that also
helps us in our mission to make a positive impact at origin. And we’re really
proud of what we came up with, [but as we’ve said
before,](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/04/21/pods-beta-testing-what-were-
doing-to-deliver-better-tasting-pods/) we’re not stopping there.

Pods were new to us, so like everything we do, we asked our customers about
their experiences in order to find out how we could make future versions even
better than the first. As usual, our customers came up with the goods, and we
got some really helpful feedback. So helpful in fact, we’ve been able to make
some pretty exciting changes…

…And we’ve got a brand new pod to prove it.

##### We hear you

Our customers told us where we could improve, and we listened. Here are just
some of the ways we’ve made Pact Pods even better this time around.

##### “My machine was harder to close”

Some people told us they found their machine was just that bit harder to close
with the first round of pods. This was to do with the design of the pod
casing.

Without going too much into the mechanics of your average pod machine, there
are little needles that pierce the base of the capsule and the foil wrap on
top. This is what creates the flow that produces your cup of coffee.

##### What’s new?

Hope you don’t mind us geeking out for a second, but these new pods are cool.
Really cool. The reason being that, rather than requiring the needle to pierce
the plastic to create a flow of water, they use the needles in an entirely new
way.

Basically, there are six little openings at the base of each plastic casing*.
They start off sealed (preserving the freshness and flavour), but pop open
with the force of the needles when you close your machine.

_*You’ll notice that these flaps make a clicking noise when they open. It’s
nothing to worry about, just the sound of your lovely coffee brewing._

##### “My coffee wasn’t pouring like other brands of pods”

Others found that they weren’t getting the same quick pour they usually get
with other brands of pods. This also was to do with the design of the original
capsule casings.

##### What’s new?

The new design of the pods actually helps with any issues people might have
had with pouring. Naturally, we’ve tested this new lot with customers and in
our own homes, and so far, so good!

It is worth noting, however, that our pods won’t ever pour as quickly as a lot
of other brands of pods, and there’s good reason. The roast level and grind
size of our pods’ coffee were carefully considered in order to maximise
flavour (you can read about [here](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/11/13/were-
in-the-home-stretch/)). However, the slightly lighter roast leads to a slower
extraction. So, yes, your pod will pour slower than usual, but you’ll be
rewarded with an excellent cup of coffee at the end.

##### We couldn’t have done it without you

We’re really excited about the next development in our journey towards
producing incredible tasting, better quality and more [environmentally
sustainable pods](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/27/our-hunt-for-a-more-
sustainable-pod/), and we hope you like them, too.

We won’t ever stop trying to improve, whether it’s through developing our pods
or our service in general. We love your feedback, so please don’t hold back.
