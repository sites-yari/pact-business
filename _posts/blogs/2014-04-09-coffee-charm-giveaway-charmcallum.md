[![Pact Coffee The Charm
Works](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/necklaces.jpeg?w=300)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/necklaces.jpeg)We’ve
got three coffee charm necklaces to give away!

Isn’t it nice when you discover you have friendly neighbours? Unless of course
they’re too friendly and they keep popping over for sugar, or to read you your
horoscope or chat about the local pigeons.

But we digress.

Our neighbours at Pact HQ happen to be none other than [The Charm
Works](http://www.thecharmworks.com/), who have demonstrated their
neighbourliness by giving us three coffee-related necklaces to give away.

There are two different designs up for grabs, a coffee cup and a coffee pot,
both of which come on a delicate sterling silver chain. So what do you have to
do to win one?

Simple. Charm Callum:

So here’s what you need to do:

  * Take a selfie / picture of yourself
  * Make sure you’re holding a coffee
  * Don’t forget to pout (or pull a similarly ‘charming’ face)
  * Tweet us at [@pactcoffee](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee) with the hash [#charmcallum](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23charmcallum&src=typd&f=realtime)

It’ll then be up to him to pick three ‘charmers’ at random within the next
week…

Below you’ll see our efforts to #charmcallum at Pact HQ (you’re looking at
