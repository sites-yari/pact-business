My name is Tony and I’ve joined Pact to look after Technology and marry that
up with the Product.

I used to drink coffee for the caffeine kick, but that was back at University,
you know, those late nights in the library?! But now I’m a grown up, I’ve come
to appreciate food, red wine and fresh coffee. With fresh coffee comes lots of
flavours, and I’m excited to introduce and delivery those flavours to every
home in the country.

My background is in Software development, so I write 10010111010010111010110
and stuff. Along side that, I am an endurance sports junkie, with my next
challenge being a 70.3 mile Ironman. Yikes!

I’m at Pact because I love fresh coffee and I want fresh coffee to appear in
your kitchen counter without you having to think about it. So you wake up,
make your brew and sip. Doesn’t that sound great?

Having been at Pact for a month, I already feel like part of the
furniture.I’ll share a secret with you, Zach didn’t pack all your coffee, I
packed some too, but he gets to sign it.

If you have any ideas of how I can make your Pact coffee experience better,
I’d love to hear from you, my email is
[tony@pactcoffee.com](mailto:tony@pactcoffee.com), I look forward to hearing
from you.
