Maybe you’ve heard whispers… changes have been happening in the world of Pact
Coffee. We’ve come a long way from Stephen Rapoport’s kitchen, setting up camp
in Bermondsey to do _everything_ from roasting and grinding to writing,
selling and marketing.

But we’ve been growing – and like a hermit crab having to look for a new
shell, we needed to find a bigger roastery that’d let us supply you lot with
all the coffee you’ve been ordering! Search as we may, there weren’t any
spacious roasting facilities knocking about around central London. So we had
to do what anyone who’s thinking of buying a house does – we looked outside of
zone 1… in fact, we looked outside of every zone!

Introducing: the Haslemere roastery! It was a perfect fit. Close enough to our
main office, enough room to set up a proper operation and the right sort of
facility for our needs. Read our MD’s thoughts

coffee-subscription-service).

But it was no mean feat. We had to negotiate moving a whole roastery
(including a _beast_ of a roaster and grinding, packaging and labelling
equipment) without disrupting orders. And that’s definitely oversimplifying
it. Just look what we had to do:

**Logistics**

  * Organise enough stock to cover two weeks of trading
  * Dismantle our beastly _one tonne_ roaster over just a weekend, to make sure there were no interruptions to orders 
  * Organise the move of all the equipment, in pieces, on an enormous lorry
  * Reassemble the roaster at our new location
  * Connect all supplies and ensure the roaster boots up and roasts without faults
  * Plan an efficient layout for green coffee storage, roasted coffee storage, ground coffee storage, weighing, grinding, packing and dispatch
  * Dismantle, ship and set up the whole operation in two days

**Roasting Set-up**

  * Install and modify gas, electric and water supply to the correct specifications
  * Modify all roast profiles to the new roaster set-up – different gas pressure, flue-length, and environmental conditions means that all coffee profiles have to be adapted in order to produce consistent results
    * Which involves lots of test roasting and comparative cupping!
    * And also having to deal with difficulties in profiling coffees to deliver the results all our Pact Coffee customers are used to!
  * Check mains water conditions to meet required cupping/brewing specs; buy filters and set bypass levels accordingly
  * Build a new quality control lab, kitted out with a cupping grinder, water boiler, espresso machine, sample roaster – and all to meet strict specifications

…phew. And that’s not to mention hiring a new set of staff to support the main
roasters. But we think the team has done a ruddy, bloody good job so far! Why
not join us in raising a glass (of cold brew) to our new Haslemere-based
operations?
