  * Introduce your friends to Pact and they’ll get their first bag for just £1

  * If we can find 1,000 new customers this week we’ll be able to add an extra special sixth coffee to our range

  * Everyone’s a winner.

**Here’s the thing**

Here at Pact we like to think we have something of a symbiotic relationship
with our community. You’ve told us you want a sixth coffee added to the Pact
selection but we’re going to need your help to do so. You see, to add another
coffee we need to grow in size a little – and fast – which is where you come
in….

**Spread the joy**

Know someone who would enjoy Pact’s fresh roasted coffee, delivered right to
their door? Then tell them about us and they’ll get their first bag for just
£1:

**Send them to[www.pactcoffee.com](http://www.pactcoffee.com), armed with the
voucher code ‘#joyofsix’.**

After they’ve received their first £1 bag, each 250g bag will be £6.95 and
delivered according to their needs – weekly, fortnightly or on dates they
specify.

**Why will 1,000 news customers make a difference?**

Quite a lot of work goes into sourcing and preparing a new coffee for the Pact
line-up:

  * The work begins with our Head of Coffee, Gabi, who needs to find the green bean of choice then put it through some rigorous QA taste tests.
  * Once the new star has been chosen and shipped over to us it needs to be roasted to perfection by our team in London.
  * Then, once it’s roasted and ready, it needs to be ground to your specification and packed up for next day delivery, which is no mean feat!

So, the more people we’re doing this for, the more economical the whole
process will be. We’re only a relatively small team after all!

**No time like the present!**

Where coffee is concerned it’s good to strike while the iron is hot. So if we
can add 1,000 new customers within a week we’ll be able to get our brand new
coffee up and running in line with our next big bean shipment and before the
Christmas rush strikes. No pressure or anything…

Email your boss about it. It’ll make you look savvy and thoughtful.

**A final thought about symbiotic relationships…**

In the wild ostriches and zebras are pretty much BFFs. The zebra has an
excellent sense of smell but can’t see that well, while the ostrich has a
pretty poor sense of smell but really good eyesight. As a result these guys
hang out together and help to warn each other about predators and stuff. So,
let’s all take a leaf out of their book, except instead of helping each other
escape predators we’ll be helping each other enjoy better, fresher coffee.
