Ok, not actually marmite. We’re not that brave. But this Ethiopian coffee is
definitely a ‘love it or hate it’ kind of coffee. And we kinda love that…

On paper, it sounds universally delicious. Black tea, lemon and blackcurrant
flavour notes with a buttery mouthfeel, and light orange acidity. Mmm! But
when we first debuted it in 2016, there were some very strong opinions. Some
people thought it was fantastic and… others not not so much. And there’s an
interesting reason for why that might be.

When some people think ‘coffee’, what they’re really thinking of is Brazilian
coffee. It’s chocolatey and nutty, with a strong body and more darkly roasted.
But the strange thing is that this Ethiopian coffee, more floral and tea-like,
is much closer to what coffee would have originally tasted like. After all,
Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee!

We think it’s great that there’s so much diversity when it comes to coffee
flavours but, if you’re not sure if this is the brew for you, then here’s a
helpful comparison. A fan of Reisling, unoaked Chardonnay or Prosecco? Then
you’ll probably love this coffee! Find out what coffee started off tasting
like by getting your own bag…
