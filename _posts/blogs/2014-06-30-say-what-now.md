If you’ve visited our [Coffee Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)
recently and clicked to find out more about any of our coffees, you may have
noticed a bit of a shake up. Oh yes, these pages now reference some slightly
serious coffee-tasting stuff…

[![Four cupping coffee
qualities](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/four-
qualities2.jpg?w=545)](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/four-
qualities2.jpg)

You may know exactly what we’re on about when we say a coffee has an ‘orange
acidity’ but if not this blog post should help. When looking to add new
coffees to our menu we consider four different qualities:

**Flavour** – It may sound weird but this is not what happens on your tongue
(that’s taste) but what happens in the space behind your nose. Flavour is
usually delicate and relies on memories of things you’ve tasted before rather
than a bold physical sensation.  
_**Flavour examples – raspberries, chocolate, hazelnuts, florals**_

**Sweetness** – The sensation of sweetness on the tongue, which can remind you
of lots of different things.  
_**Sweetness examples – white refined sugar, brown sugar, fruit sugars.**_

**Acidity** – This actually has nothing to do with the pH of the coffee, but
refers to the tangy, fruity, brightness that creates complex tastes in the
coffee.  
_**Acidity examples – oranges, apples, grapes.**_

**Mouthfeel** – Describes the way a coffee would move or dance in your mouth.  
_**Mouthfeel examples – heavy, round, light, tea-like, coating, juicy.**_

But the proof of the pudding is in the tasting, so do watch out for these
things when you get [your next Pact
delivery](https://www.pactcoffee.com/account). And if you have any questions
about what you can taste in your Pact Coffee then feel free to [email them to
