title: Pure and Simple Peanut Butter & Banana Slice
---

There’s a new hashtag on the block, and it’s ‘#fitspo’. As in ‘fitspiration’.
As in fitness and inspiration combined. It seems to involve eating like a
caveman (lots of meat and nuts), working out – hard – then taking selfies of
your perfectly chiseled abdominals.

As you can tell we’re still kind of new to the whole thing, but if you’re
already a fitspo freak then you may be pleased to hear that your daily brew no
longer has to be a guilty pleasure. In fact, a pre-workout cup of coffee can
actually go hand-in-hand with your health and fitness regimen.

Your caffeine fix has been proven to increase performance while decreasing
post-workout muscle pain. This wonder-drink can even accelerate fat loss! What
does this mean for you? Well, you can exercise more efficiently, leaving more
time for post-workout #fitspo selfies, of course!

So, now that your skinny flat white has been mentally deleted from the ‘vice’
column in your head, we’ve got just the recipe to celebrate! After one bite of
this nutritious and delicious peanut butter and banana slice, we’re sure
you’ll happily accept a new not-so-guilty pleasure in your life!

Enjoy this lovely and simple recipe with your favourite blend of [Pact
coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees "Pact Coffee") before tackling your
next big workout.

**Ingredients**

Base  
1 cup chopped nuts (almonds, brazil nuts and/or walnuts work well)  
1 handful chopped dates  
Small tbsp honey

Topping **  
** Tbsp peanut butter (homemade or organic for bonus health points!)  
1 handful chopped dates  
½ cup almond milk  
1 banana (mashed)

**Method**

1\. Begin by lining a tray with baking paper.  
2\. To make the base combine the nuts, one handful of dates and the honey in a
bowl.  
3\. Once the mixture is formed, firmly press the base into the tray.  
4\. Place the tray in the fridge to set.  
5\. While you wait for the base, pour all the topping ingredients into a
saucepan and heat gently until thick and smooth.  
6\. Spread this mixture over your base and place in the fridge for about two
hours. Et voila!

Optional toppings such as coconut or a cheeky drizzle of melted chocolate will
ensure your slice looks as good as it tastes.

**TIP:** The base for this recipe makes a fabulously healthy replacement for
any biscuit base from cheesecake to flapjacks!
