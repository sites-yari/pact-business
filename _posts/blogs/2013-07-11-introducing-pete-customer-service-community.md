Hi, I’m Pete and I will be looking after Customer Service and Community at
Pact. I joined Pact partly because I love helping customers with any questions
they might have, and partly because I believe that Pact can finally be the
company to end the reign of instant coffee over our homes.

As I am finishing my second week at Pact, I can’t help but reflect on all the
things that have already happened during my short time here; the amount of
amazing customers I’ve interacted with, over email, phone and when they popped
into the office; the amount of new customers we had, who I thought were going
to break our system, while in fact, were completely predicted by Stephen and
Zach; the “milk in coffee” session, where a coffee ended up tasting like mushy
peas; all the culinary delights Bermondsey has to offer; and mainly, all the
things I’ve learnt already.

My job is to deliver world-class customer service to the Pact community, so if
you have any suggestions or feedback for anything Pact related (actually, non-
Pact related is fine too) let me know, and I will see what I can do about it.

You can reach me at pete (at) pactcoffee.com, 0207 231 2047, or on Twitter
