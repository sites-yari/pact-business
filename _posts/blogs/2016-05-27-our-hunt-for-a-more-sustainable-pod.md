For some coffee lovers, the single serve coffee machine is a blessing from
above. And why not? It’s quick, convenient and now that companies like Pact
are offering speciality options, you can enjoy a top-notch coffee at the touch
of a button.

In the other camp, however, the environmental impact pods present sets
internal alarm bells ringing. And the concerns we’ve heard from Pact customers
about pod waste has not gone unnoticed.

In fact, it was a major consideration for us. Throughout the design process
for our own NespressoⓇ-compatible pods, we were determined to come up with a
more sustainable option. We soon realised, however, that the technology for
creating biodegradable capsule casings just isn’t there yet. Basically, they
had shortcomings that we just couldn’t ignore and if we’re to achieve our
mission of making coffee a force for good, we need to provide people with
better quality coffee that has a positive impact at origin. Our pods do just
that by providing a great-tasting alternative to the big guys.

So we wanted to explain why, right now, they’re not an option for Pact, and
how we ended up choosing the recyclable pods we currently use.

##### Our trials with biodegradable options

If you know anything about the [research and development of Pact
Pods](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/11/13/were-in-the-home-stretch/), you’d
know it was a long and considered process. As with everything we do,
protecting the flavour and quality of our coffee is one of our top priorities
and small changes to things like grind size and the materials we used could
have a dramatic impact on flavour and freshness.

After experimenting with pod casings made from a starch-based polymer, we had
high hopes. Unfortunately, we were disappointed to find they didn’t preserve
any of the lovely flavours in the coffee. The reason for this is that they
don’t provide a strong enough oxygen barrier, meaning air was able to
infiltrate the casing. Bad news for freshness and flavour.

  
The fix for this? Pods made from this material come packaged in a sealed
container, which, once opened, also lets oxygen in, damaging the remaining
pods in the container. Can you see a pattern forming?

  
Another issue we found was that, if left in the machine after use (as pretty
much all of us do), the pod quickly decomposes. It’s a good sign because it
means they’re doing their job. But when it comes down to it, the machines
broke. And no-one wants a soggy, impossible-to-remove pod getting stuck in
that handy capsule machine of theirs.

##### Where we’re at…

So far, we haven’t found a pod casing that preserves the quality of our coffee
in the same way our current capsules do. Made from polybutylene terephthalate
(PBT), a food-grade type of plastic, the capsule itself is recyclable, as is
the foil (plus, coffee makes a great compost). It also provides a really
strong barrier to oxygen, which means the coffee comes out tasting as great as
it did going in. All it takes to recycle responsibly is separating the parts,
there are even easy-to-follow instructions on the inside of our 40 packs of
pods.

##### We’re not stopping there

It’s just not our style to rest on our laurels. Giving people the chance to
indulge their coffee cravings is great, but we’re always trying to do better
where we can and being as sustainable as possible is really important to us.
Which is why we’ve chosen recyclable materials as we continue to search for
better, environmentally sound alternatives.
