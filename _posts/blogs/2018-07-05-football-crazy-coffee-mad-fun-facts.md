You’re worried. Is football coming home, or will _you_ be the one angrily
fumbling for your front door keys after a post-defeat comfort drinking sesh?
It’s the only thing on everyone’s minds, seeping into the city’s collective
consciousness. Even the ice cream van outside the Pact office keeps playing
the Match of the Day theme as its chimes!

We’re here to calm you down. Grab a cup of
[Karinga](https://www.pactcoffee.com/shop/karinga-peaberry-pre-order) or a
cheeky [cold brew](https://www.pactcoffee.com/shop/cold-brew-kit), pull up a
pew and distract yourself (kind of) with a random assortment of fun facts
about coffee and football!

  * Let’s _kick off_ with one loosely related to [Sidamo](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/sidamo) – our coffee sourced from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange. Did you know that there’s an Ethiopian Coffee Football Club? It’s based in Addis Ababa – it only formed in 1975 but by 1981 they had already won four trophies and one fair play award. Nice!

  * Famous Brazilian footie player, Romario, reportedly used to drink at least [ten cups of coffee a _day_](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ObmQAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT434&dq=soccer+coffee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjaiPygl4XcAhVsDMAKHSwkDkgQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=soccer%20coffee&f=false) _._ Even during matches! Someone grab Vardy a latte, could they?

  * Getting literary with it: in a novel that founded Brazilian Modernism, it’s claimed that [both coffee and football originated in Brazil](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IcPaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&dq=football+coffee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibwdCJl4XcAhVjJcAKHdu-AJUQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&q=football%20coffee&f=false)! We’re not sure about that, but there’s no denying that they dominate in both those areas today. In Mário de Andrade’s 1928 novel Macunaima, one brother turns a brick into a football to kick at his brother – for hiding a biting bug in his coffee grounds! Yeah, we don’t get it either.

  * Coffee and football used to be strongly linked in… [Austria](http://www.mabellehouse.com/en/Blog/Coffee-Houses-of-Vienna-Birthplace-of-Intelligent-Football-110)! They didn’t qualify this time, but back in the 1930s there was a strong tradition of Austrian football teams having a local coffee-house. Instead of popping down your local boozer to rowdily discuss whatever ludicrous display you’d just witnessed, football fans would grab an espresso to talk tactics. We’re down with that!

  * Less a football fact, but maybe some essential insider info before Saturday’s England v. Sweden game… Coffee has been [banned](https://www.thelocal.se/20180702/why-coffee-was-banned-in-sweden-five-times) a mind-blowing _five_ times in Sweden! This was partly due to beliefs that drinking it came with a number of horrifying side effects – though they must have forgotten all about that now, as they’re now one of the [highest coffee-consuming countries](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/here-are-the-countries-that-drink-the-most-coffee-the-us-isnt-in-the-top-10/283100/) per capita.

**Farmers & Football – The Pact Lowdown **

If that hasn’t helped your nerves, let’s try something else. Football is truly
a global sport, so why not see whose colours our incredible coffee farmers are
wearing?

will. Play on!
