One of the pacts we have with our customers is that our coffee is packed and
shipped no more than seven days after roasting. So, since you know [who’s been
packing your coffee](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/10/find-out-whos-been-
packing-your-coffee/ "Find out who’s been packing your coffee…"), we thought
it was about time you found out who takes care of the roasting side of things.
His name is Peter and he’s something of a dude…

**A bit about Peter** The Pact coffee roaster is called Peter James, and he –
and his coffee roasters – are based in the picturesque Ross-on-Wye, in
Herefordshire. It’s a lovely part of the world, which narrowly escaped
flooding in the crazy weather at the start of this year. Peter lives in a
cottage near the roasting house (though he plans to move to a small farm soon,
where he’s going to grow apples for homemade cider) and classes himself as a
proper country bumpkin. He also happens to have 15 years experience in the art
of roasting coffee. This man really knows his beans.

**What’s it like at the
roasters?**[Stephen](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/02/19/introducing-
stephen-rapoport-founder/ "Introducing… Stephen Rapoport, Founder") and
[Pete](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/07/11/introducing-pete-customer-
service-community/ "Introducing… Pete, Customer Service & Community") recently
checked in to see how it was going over there and reported back to the rest of
us here in Bermondsey. They watched some of our coffee being roasted (see
below), a process that takes between 15 and 20 minutes, depending on the
degree of roasting you’re after. In case you’ve never experienced it, the
smell of roasting coffee is pretty strong, but not one you’d associate with
brewing coffee. It’s more like a cross between popcorn and slightly overdone
toast.

Pete and Stephen recently went to visit Peter’s roasterie in Herefordshire

**A bit about Peter’s roasterie** The Ross-on-Wye roasterie is home to two
roasters, a Diedrich (the red one in the picture above) with a 15 kilo
capacity and a rather fancy Loring (the silver one) with a 35 kilo capacity.
It’s the Loring that is used to roast the majority of our coffee and it is
something of a hero within the coffee roasting world; as you’ll discover
below. Peter’s roasterie also boasts a coffee playroom, where you’ll find some
seriously shiny coffee gadgetry.

**About the Loring roaster** When coffee is roasted an enormous amount of
strong-smelling smoke is usually produced, which is too potent to be released
straight into the air (especially in built-up areas). To burn off this smoke,
some coffee roasters have built-in afterburners. On the face of it this seems
like a good thing, but in actuality afterburners use up seven times as much
energy as the roasting process does in the first place.

The Loring is different. This next generation roaster all the way from
California uses state of the art technology, which means it significantly cuts
down on the smoke. While many other roasters are now following suit with
smokeless coffee roasters, Peter was one of the trail blazers and he owned one
of the very first ones in the country. He’s so cool.

**Taking good care of your beans** One of the key parts of the roasting
process actually comes after the beans are done ‘cooking’. To prevent from
over roasting they need to be cooled down as quickly as possible. This is done
by pouring the beans into a cooling bin, which looks like a great barrel, with
wire mesh over either end. Air is then drawn through the freshly roasted beans
by a powerful (noisy) fan, as they are kept moving with giant rotating
paddles. In this way the beans are cooled from 200°c to room temperature in a
matter of minutes, and the flavours contained within the beans are preserved
for you to enjoy.
