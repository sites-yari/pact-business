**Four of the Best Festive Gifts for Coffee-Lovers**

‘Tis the season to drink coffee, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la! That’s how the
song goes, right? Well it is at Pact HQ.

Though December is not yet upon us, we are spreading good cheer all over the
place in the form of top-notch, freshly-roasted coffee right to people’s homes
and offices. In fact, we spread joy through coffee all year round, so this
Christmas, why don’t you join us?

Below you’ll find four can’t-fail-to-please coffee gifts. These little
beauties are bound to delight any coffee-lovers that happen to be on your gift
list, the only question is – how much are you willing to spend on them…?

**Stocking filler: PACT’S CHRISTMAS BLEND**

If sales of last year’s Christmas Blend are anything to go by, this year’s is
going to be flying out of Pact HQ faster than Santa flies out of The North
Pole. It boasts warm notes of mince pie and rich cream, so basically it’s
Christmas in a cup.

Bonus points for you if you’re going to be spending Christmas morning with the
lucky recipient. Sharing a cup of Christmas Blend on Christmas morning
(probably listening to Slade while wearing something woollen) is about as
festive as you can get.

**Christmas treat: BUENOS AIRES**

This is a true cracker of a coffee (Christmas pun intended, natch). After
achieving a perfect score in Colombia’s National Quality Competition, there
was a bidding war for this deliciously elegant coffee. Happily for us Will,
our Head of Coffee, was tenacious enough to win it.

Buenos Aires boasts perfectly balanced ginger, grapefruit and nectarine
flavours, so put simply, Will couldn’t let it get away. It’s yours to try or –
in the spirit of Christmas – share. Just choose who you give it to wisely;
this coffee deserves a loving home.

**Pre-Christmas Splurge: PACT COFFEE ADVENT CALENDAR**

Last year The Pact Coffee Advent Calendar was new to the scene, so it really
shook things up for December. No longer were people lured through the month by
individual daily morsels of average-quality chocolate, no, they met each
December morning with a spring in their step and the promise of a sensational
cup of coffee.

This year the calendar is made up of 25 carefully-curated coffees. Each coffee
delivers its own unique flavours and comes complete with little info nuggets
to introduce you to what you’re drinking. It would make the perfect pre-
Christmas Christmas gift, either for a coffee lover you know, or perhaps as a
treat for yourself…

**Their cup runneth over: THE SAGE EXPRESS ESPRESSO MACHINE**

How about giving someone the gift of being able to make Barista-standard
espresso at home? Designed by Sage, alongside the exacting standards of Heston
Blumenthal, this is a coffee-lover’s dream machine.

Pact Founder, Stephen Rapoport, is a huge fan of the Sage Barista Express: “In
my view this is the best value espresso machine on the planet. I have used
mine daily for over a year and both my wife and I love it – great espresso,
perfect milk and the right level of control for me. I even bought one for my
dad, though this was partly for my own benefit when I visit!”
