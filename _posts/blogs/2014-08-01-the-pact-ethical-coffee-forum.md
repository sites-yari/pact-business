title: The Pact Ethical Coffee Forum
---

Over the past four weeks we’ve taken the first steps in our journey towards
becoming a robustly ethical coffee company. The response to our first [blog
post](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/07/03/not-fairtrade-and-proud/ "Not
Fairtrade. And why that’s okay.") about Fairtrade was phenomenal – we were so
happy to start a discussion about something so many of you are passionate
about.

Following the response, we worked hard to address all your questions, but we
thought the subject deserved a bit more back and forth. So we took the chance
to work with all of you to develop our fledgling ethical coffee sourcing
policies – and that’s how the Pact Ethical Coffee Forum was born.

The event meant people could come to Pact HQ, or join us online, to engage in
a live discussion with Stephen, Rob and Will about how we source our coffee.

We began with Stephen, our founder, explaining our position on Fairtrade
certification, and what Pact has planned to ensure that we trade coffee
ethically. This was followed by an hour and a half of rich and informative
discussions, in which Stephen, Rob and Will fielded questions from the in-room
audience, Twitter and Google Hangouts Q&A. Needless to say, it was an exciting
and unique challenge. _(In case you missed it, you can watch the whole thing
on our[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcgVlV2MR0).)_

So, what’s next? What does the future hold for Pact’s ethical sourcing
policies? Let’s break it down:

**Our sourcing Pact  
** In roughly six months time, 95% of our coffee will be independently sourced
by Will (our Head of Coffee). This means that we can make the journey from
bean to cup more transparent than ever. For every coffee we buy direct from
the farmer, we will publish how much over the Fairtrade rate we have paid and
guarantee that this percentage will always be higher than 25%. These figures
will be externally audited by KPMG, so you don’t just have to take our word
for it. In addition, we will generally post more about the farms and our
farmers (including a selfie or two from Will).

**An exciting project**  
An exciting result of the overall discussion, beginning with the very first
blog post, is our proposed research project. If we choose not to be Fairtrade
certified and cannot afford to audit all of our farms, we need to find an
alternative. There are plenty of issues that we could look into, but as a
small company we need to prioritise.

Our main focus will be examining how much the workers get paid on the
speciality coffee farms we source from. As the workers hired by the farmers
are skilled at picking the coffee beans at exactly the right time, our
hypothesis is that they are paid well above the national minimum wage. This is
to both reward their skill and to encourage them to return for the next
harvest. Whilst anecdotal evidence strongly backs up this claim, we know that
this is not good enough. So we have partnered with SOAS (School of Oriental
and African Studies) to conduct research into the connection between
speciality coffee farms and the wages of the coffee bean pickers who work on
them. Initial conversations have highlighted the potential of using big data,
through crowdsourcing information, but we would love any other suggestions on
how we could carry out the research effectively.

Other priorities include transportation ethics (our carbon footprint, shipping
workers’ rights etc), environmental sustainability of the coffee farms, and
whether we can have a wider social impact on the coffee communities.

We don’t profess to have all the answers but, with your help and some hard
work at Pact HQ, we hope to find them.
