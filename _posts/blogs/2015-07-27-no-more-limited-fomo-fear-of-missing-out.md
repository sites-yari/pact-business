It used to be, when you ordered a Limited Edition Coffee it’d come when your
next delivery was scheduled. That’s all well and good, but it meant that
sometimes – if your next bag was a little while off – there was a chance you’d
miss out.

To save disappointment, now when you order a Limited Edition Coffee, we’ll
fast-track the bag so it’s delivered as soon as possible. So if you order it
before 1pm Monday to Friday, it’ll arrive the very next day!

Plus, because we never want you to have too much coffee at home, we’ll
reschedule your next regular bag of coffee too. That way, it’ll arrive when
you need a top up.
