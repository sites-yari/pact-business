we’re going to have a little Pact Bake Off of our own here at Pact HQ.

The recipe we’re all going to be using can be found below and points will be
awarded for:

– but most of all **flair**.

So, if you don’t want to miss out on the delicious, cakey fun then why not
bake your own entry? Simply follow the recipe below, take a picture of your
