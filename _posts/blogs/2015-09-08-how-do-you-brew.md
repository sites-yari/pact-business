##### Brew methods and their perks.

**Picking a brew method is very personal. Deciding which one suits you can
come down to a number of factors, like the kind of flavours you like, ease of
use, or you might even choose based on how it looks.**

At Pact, we see the beauty in all brew methods. That’s why we grind your
coffee specifically to get the best out of the kit you’ve got at home – we can
even recommend which coffees suit your brew method best! Read on to see what
we like about each one.

An easy one to perfect. The paper filter increases the clarity, which makes it
really simple to pick up on flavours, acidity and sweetness. The iconic V60
dripper is a great way to get into filter coffee.

Easy to use, and master. The ground coffee is immersed rather than having
water forced through it, giving it the heavier mouthfeel and richer flavour.
The long brew time means a higher caffeine kick.

##### [![Espresso](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/wp-

Naturally, espresso brewing is quick. Because it produces such a small
quantity, the flavour is incredibly intense, with a thick mouthfeel. Add
steamed milk and get creative with your lattes.

It’s an early take on an espresso machine. So if you like the rich, full
flavour and heavy mouthfeel of an espresso without the expense and bulk of a
machine, this is for you.

Makes a mean coffee quickly and easily. The Aeropress combines total immersion
with filter paper and gets really consistent results every time. It’s hard to
go wrong brewing with an Aeropress.
