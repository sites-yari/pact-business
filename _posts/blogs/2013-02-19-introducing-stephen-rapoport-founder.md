Howdy!

I launched YourGrind (as it was originally called) back in October, and would
like to update you all on what’s been happening, our objectives and a little
of what we have planned. After all, we’re doing it all for you!

A little Background

Two passions have been constant in my life; startups and coffee. I never
appreciated how clichéd that is until I typed it this morning! Running my last
business was a wonderful experience but when it came to planning the next I
had one objective – work with a product that I love so much that it couldn’t
feel like work. Coffee was the only real option.

What’s the point!?

The coffee industry in the UK needs some work. 77% of coffee drunk at home is
instant. WTF!? The ‘real’ coffee sold in supermarkets is, by and large,
dreadful. I could write a book on the reasons but the summary is probably
familiar– the drive for lower costs has lead to aggressive production methods
and poorer quality. Plantations, nitrogen purging, omni-grinding and months in
storage have all stripped coffee of it’s beauty. Fortunately it doesn’t bare
any resemblance whatsoever to horse meat…

So how can you help?

Our business is expanding fast, and it is my responsibility to ensure that you
guys are steering the ship. What does that mean? You can contact me any time,
or any of our growing team. If there’s anything you’d like us to start doing
(or stop, for that matter) let us know. Want a broader range of coffee? Or
fewer options? Decaf? Green? Email me or tweet us any time. Want to come and
say hi? Our office is in Bermondsey, the coffee is exceptional and we’d love
to meet you. We’re redesigning the site, adding loads of great new features
and designing mobile apps at the moment and I’m certain you could help.

In the meantime, I’m here to help.
