title: "Experimenting with Coffee Workshop \u2013 18th December"

Here at Pact we like really good coffee but we do not like coffee snobbery.
That’s why we’ve decided to put together a series of no-nonsense blog posts
and workshops to help you get the most from your bean. The first of these
workshops will be:

**Experimenting with Coffee**  
**Wednesday 18th December at Pact HQ in Bermondsey**

**What’s involved?**  
We’ll be using V60 drip filters to look at three variables in coffee; grind
size, grind weight and water volume. Altering all these things can produce
really different results in terms of flavour and strength, so playing with
them could allow you to find your perfect cup – and have a jolly nice time
while you’re at it.

During the workshop we’ll all have a go at three sets of experiments:

  * altering grind size – keeping grind weight and volume of water the same
  * altering grind weight – keeping grind size and volume of water the same
  * altering volume of water – keeping grind size and weight the same.

**Drop the snobbery**  
Industry experts claim that there are correct ratios for all the above. It’s
possible to go into specific formulas, cup of excellence parameters and
international grading standards – but this workshop is about exploring your
options. We’ll be using recommended procedures but we’ll be adding a dash of
intuition as we go. After all, every individual’s taste tends to be different.

**I don’t know anything about coffee, can I come?**  
Absolutely! The whole idea behind ‘Know Your Beans’ is making the sometimes
intimidating world of gourmet coffee open to all.

**How do I sign up?**
