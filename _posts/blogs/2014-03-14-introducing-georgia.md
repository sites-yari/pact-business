[![Pact Coffee Team Georgia
recipes](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image.jpeg?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image.jpeg)Anyone
who likes eating really tasty stuff will be glad that Georgia has joined the
Pact blogging team. While working in [The Pact Packing
Room](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/10/find-out-whos-been-packing-your-
coffee/ "Find out who’s been packing your coffee…") she revealed her passion
for all things foodie and so we persuaded her to get busy on the blog. She’ll
be creating and writing up [coffee-friendly
recipes](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/coffee-academy/baking-with-
pact/), which either incorporate coffee as a key ingredient or go perfectly
with a cup of piping hot Pact Coffee.

Georgia is always looking for new inspiration and ideas, so if you’re
something of whiz in the kitchen then do feel free to share your recipes with
Georgia. If you have your own food blog we can even link through to it! You
can get in touch with her via

**A quick Q &A with Georgia:**

**What do you do at Pact?**  
Part-time packer, part-time blog contributor.

**What’s your favourite part of the working day (please don’t say home
time)?**  
My morning coffee is always nice… the subsequent coffees are a close second,
third, fourth etc.

**Tell us a bit about where you worked P.P. (Pre-Pact)?**  
I was formerly the editor of Pool + Outdoor Design magazine over in Australia.
There are more pools over there than there are here. A lot more. Before that I
worked on heaps of different magazines, covering bridal, home design, kitchen
design and wineries.

**What’s your preferred brew method?**  
I have a cafetière at home, but I can never pass up a flat white.

Moomins](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img-

Little My from The Moomins

**What does your favourite mug look like?**  
When I wear my hair in a bun, I apparently look like the Little My from The
Moomins. A friend gave me a mug with her on it for Christmas. I love it, but I
also secretly hope I don’t look as angry as she does!

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**  
I think [New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the
Ankh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNbW0gizqTE) by Erykah Badu is a great
Sunday album. And Sunday is clearly the best day for drinking coffee.

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**  
I’d like to be able to melt into a high-speed, liquid silver puddle like Alex
Mack. I could get around everywhere really fast and melt my friends too, when
I needed to.

****If you really wanted to impress someone w** hat dessert would you make to
go with after-dinner coffee?  
**Technically this is my mum’s go-to dessert, but I think there’s nothing more
impressive and hearty than a sticky date pudding. It’s just like a sticky
toffee pudding, but with dates, it’s such a friendly, cosy cake ideal for
sharing with friends and family! It also happens to go perfectly with coffee.
