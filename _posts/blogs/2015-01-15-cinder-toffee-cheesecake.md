title: Cinder Toffee Cheesecake
---

This recipe is the brainchild of Pact Customer, Cassie who put together this
delicious marvel for her own fantastic blog (
**[cassiefairy.com](http://cassiefairy.com/)** ). The reason she then passed
it on to us is that the cake was inspired by Pact’s very own Finca La Montaña
Espresso, which our coffee guy, Will, found to have a cinder toffee flavour.

Finca La Montaña Espresso isn’t on the **[Pact Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=coffeemenu&utm_campaign=20150115blog)** currently but this
cheesecake is a thoroughly magnificent accompaniment to any cup of fresh Pact
Coffee. New Year’s resolutions permitting, naturally.

See how lush it looks? We had to share it.

**Ingredients**

**The Base:  
** 125g Digestive biscuits  
125g Lotus biscuits  
100g melted butter

**Filling  
** 3 tbsp strong Pact Coffee (more or less depending on taste)  
300ml double cream  
400g cream cheese  
200g mascarpone  
125g icing sugar  
100g cinder toffee.

**Method**

  1. Crush the biscuits. You can do this in a food processor or by popping them in a freezer bag and bashing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter until it resembles wet sand.
  2. Press the mixture into a spring-form tin and place in the fridge while you make the filling.
  3. For the filling, whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. Add the mascarpone, cream cheese and icing sugar and mix well.
  4. Divide the mixture into thirds and spread two-thirds over the biscuit base and return to the fridge.
  5. Add coffee to the remaining mixture, you may like to add more or less, depending on your tastes. Mix well, and use as top layer of the cake. Place in the fridge and chill for 30 minutes.
  6. When you’re ready to serve, release the sides of your cake tin and slide it onto a plate. Crush up the cinder toffee and sprinkle over the cake.

****PACT CUSTOMER TIP:** If you’re feeling extra creative, Cassie recommends
drizzling some melted chocolate over the whole thing. Bon appétit! **
