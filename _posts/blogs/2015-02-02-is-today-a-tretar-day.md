Nordic cultures are notorious for their obsession with coffee. Perhaps it’s
due to the long nights and chilly winters but the average Finnish resident
consumes an average of [12kg of
coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita)
each year — that’s compared to a humble 2.8kg annually here in the UK. What is
fascinating, however is how their love for coffee has infused into Nordic
language.

Picture this: it’s not quite lunchtime and you have already had your refill of
**[Finca El

all&utm_content=tretar&utm_campaign=20150130blog)** but still bleary eyed and
those neurons aren’t yet firing on all cylinders…

We’ve all been there. That moment when a third cup is inevitable. **The Swedes
would call this third cup a ‘ _tretår_ ’.**

In Swedish, the word ‘tar’ means coffee. A ‘patar’ is a second cup, or refill.
So a ‘tretar’ is the third cup of coffee, or a ‘threefill’.

**So there you have it. Tretår = Three-fill.**

**Can’t resist a Tretår but wary of caffeine overload?** Might be time to try
