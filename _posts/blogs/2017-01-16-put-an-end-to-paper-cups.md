**Did you know that your â€˜recyclableâ€™ takeaway paper cup isnâ€™t so
recyclable?**

Millions in the UK assume that paper cups can be recycled as many of your
favourite coffee chains like to promote their cups as being â€˜eco-friendlyâ€™.
While this is _technically_ true, the reality is only two small facilities in
the UK are even capable of recycling these cups, and one of these sites has
never even dealt with a paper cup before! So while all of these paper cups
could be recycled, there is no effort to make this happen, and most recycling
sites donâ€™t have the technology to do so.

**What makes them so difficult to recycle?**

Most recycling sites canâ€™t recycle paper cups due to the polyethylene lining
on the coffee cups which is used to keep them waterproof. Unfortunately, this
means that the majority of the annual 2.5 billion (!) used takeaway cups
either go into landfill or are incinerated.

**So what is the solution?**

The best way to deal with the paper cup problem is to quit paper cups
altogether and use travel mugs instead. Travel mugs are a great way to
transport your coffee and should last 3+ years. Also, we understand that
saying no to takeaway coffee could be too big of a sacrifice, but the majority
of coffee shops are happy to put your order in a mug, and some even offer
incentives to do so! Although, if you do want to save some money, using a
travel mug could help you ditch that expensive takeaway coffee habit and
encourage you to start brewing at home in the morning. So in addition to
helping the environment, making coffee in your own travel mug [could save you
hundreds of pounds](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2017/01/12/save-money-on-
coffee/). Win-win!

Also, if you [start a new recurring
order](https://www.pactcoffee.com/my/orders/create) with us, you can get a
KeepCup for only Â£8! ðŸ˜Š
