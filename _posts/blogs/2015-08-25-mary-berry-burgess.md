##### Introducing Mary Berry-Burgess.

No, we haven’t kidnapped Mary Berry, one better, we have her working in the
office, in the body of George Burgess (it turns out that they share the same
birthday and apparently went to the same school, although a few generations
apart!).

Every week our Coffee Wing-girl, George, bakes an absolute treat for us to all
stuff our faces with at the coffee bar. And since the cakes are too good NOT
to share, we thought we’d give you the chance to try her latest recipe: a no
bake cake. How would Mary feel about that?!

George promises us this one is an easy cake any of us can make if we have a
spare 20 minutes and a big appetite! Ready steady, bake (or not bake)!

##### You will need…

  * 400g dark chocolate
  * 60ml filter coffee (Use your V60 for this)
  * 60ml golden syrup
  * 500ml double cream
  * cocoa powder (to sprinkle on top)
  * a handful of chopped/crushed pistachios for decoration

##### George’s Magic Method

  1. Melt the chocolate with the coffee and golden syrup over a pan of simmering, (not boiling!) water. Stir often to get an even, glossy mixture.
  2. Whisk the cream until it is thick, but not stiff.
  3. Mix the chocolate and cream together until all is combined.
  4. Pour the mixture into a spring form tin, cover with cling film and refrigerate Leave for any time between overnight and a couple of days.
  5. Before you are about to serve spring the cake free and dust the cake with sieved cocoa powder.
  6. Roughly chop the pistachios and sprinkle on the top of the cake. You can spread them across the cake or leave in the centre as I have done.
  7. Serve and enjoy!
