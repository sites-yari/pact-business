As with any business, it’s our customers – A.K.A. you – who keep us coming
into work each day. Without wanting to get all mushy about it, we’d be nothing
without you.

<queue violins, a dramatic sunset and a heart-shaped box of chocolates>

For that reason we’re starting Friday Q&As on Twitter with key members of the
Pact Team. These sessions will be taking place **every Friday between 2pm and
4pm** for the next few weeks. We hope they will give you a great opportunity
to chat with us live and make sure we’re giving you the service you want.

So, if you have any questions about who we are and what we do – or thoughts on
how we can improve – then feel free to muck in using the hashtag
[**#AskPact**](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=askpact) on any of the
following dates:

**17th Jan – Stephen, our Founder,** will be taking questions on the company
as a whole  
**24th Jan – Gabi, Head of Coffee,** will be discussing the coffee we send out
to you  
**31st Jan – Tony, Head of Tech,** will be on-hand to discuss developments to
the Pact website  
**7th Feb – Richard, Head of Growth,** will be on Twitter to chat about
partnerships  
**14th Feb – Christiaan, Head of Content,** would love to hear your thoughts
on the site and blog  
**21st Feb – Pete, Head of Community,** will field your questions and feedback
on our customer service

**Here’s a taster…**  
We held a fairly impromptu one of these last Friday and got some really
interesting little info-nuggets – as you can see below:

@pactcoffee create a package that can get through letterboxes 14cm x 5cm (old
letter box). loving the coffee x #growthhacking – @ben_bleet

@pactcoffee Love the coffees I’ve had from you so far. What can we expect to
see from you in 2014? #AskPact – @LaurenceThinks

#AskPact Any tips for Aeropress recipes with Zamorana? – @tothebear
