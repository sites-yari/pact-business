**What did you do with your Saturday? Walk the dog? Lie in? Jog? Pre-
Eurovision pancakes? Here at Pact HQ we, and 30 of your fellow Pact Coffee
customers, gathered around the coffee bar and had ourselves a full-blown
Coffee Brewing Masterclass. And it wasn’t just us, we were also joined by
thousands of others, via the wonders of a Facebook live video feed.**

George led us through three brew methods and three coffees from the [Pact
Coffee Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) and did so with her signature
Saturday morning joie de vivre. Highlights included:

  * Coffee lovers posting some excellent brewing-related questions on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PactCoffee/) as we went, which George fielded live on the video feed.
  * Taking our guests on tours of Pact HQ and The Grindhouse, where we roast and grind our coffee.
  * Intrepid attendees having a bash at new brew methods under George’s encouraging tutelage.
  * Goodies for everyone who came along, complete with a tote bag, coffee samples and t-shirts.

One sad thing that happened:

  * We ordered a tonne of delicious pastries for the event and they never turned up. Needless to say we’ll never let that happen again. Saturday morning pastries are simply too important.

**FIRST UP: THE CAFETIERE  
** The majority of Pact Coffee customers brew their coffee in a cafetiere, so
we kicked off with a doozy. As you’ll see, George whipped up some [Bella
Carmona](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) in hers and shared some terrific
tips while she was at it…

Have you been mistreating your cafetiere? [This
article](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/06/three-ways-youre-abusing-your-
cafetiere-and-you-dont-even-know-it/) could help to heal your relationship
with him/her…

**SECONDLY: THE V60  
** We’ve hooked up a number of our customers with V60 brew kits, because we
think V60s are awesome. Including this brew method in our Coffee Brewing
Masterclass was a bit of a no-brainer and piqued a lot of interest among our
cyber-audience. George used this simple brew method to bring out all the
elegant flavours of our [El Tamboral](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees).
Watch the video for some hints and tips or alternatively check out [this
condensed V60 brew guide](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/06/12/the-best-drip-
filter-coffee-youll-ever-make/).

**LAST BUT NOT LEAST: THE AEROPRESS  
** George brewed up [Kamegeli Nyarusiza](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)
in the Aeropress, which drew murmurs of appreciation from the attendees. We
always advocate the inverted method for this exciting piece of kit. Watch the
vid to find out more about it, or alternatively you can take a look at our
quick reference [Aeropress brew guide

make/)here.
