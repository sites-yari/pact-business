![Coffee satsuma
experiment](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/img_5556.jpg?w=269)Oooh,
satsuma-y!

It started as a whisper, a rumour passed down through generations of coffee
buffs. Word on the street (and the internet) spread tales of satsumas being
used as Aeropress filters creating a citrus infused coffee. Naturally, at Pact
HQ these hushed tones became curious shouts of “what if..?”

“What would happen,” the people asked “if we _did_ put a slice of clementine
in an Aeropress?”

We couldn’t let it go any longer. Being fearless coffee adventurers, had to
try it – and we thought you might like to try it too!

So we placed a slice of satsuma (about 5mm thick) inside an Aeropress between
the filter and grounds. We brewed it just as we would a normal Aeropress
(don’t know how to use an Aeropress? [Take a look at our Aeropress brew
guide](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/aeropress-brewing-guide/) >)
using [El Carmen](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/16/tasting-el-carmen-
with-a-dog-named-chuck/ "Brewing El Carmen with a dog named Chuck."). It was a
little trickier than usual, because when it came time to plunge the satsuma
created more resistance, but the results were interesting.

small step for man…

We passed the finished cup around the office and everyone had a sip. The
responses were mixed and in the end the Pact team was divided.
[Junta](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/24/introducing-junta/ "Introducing…
Junta") thought it was nice but wouldn’t make it his regular, while Julie
thought the flavour was Cointreau-esque. Rob, ever the purest, simply gave it
the thumbs down.

Because it was different, in the end it became a matter of preference, and as
Stephen said: “It’s a bit weird, but I like it.”

So there you go. Another coffee experiment under our belts as we all continue
to learn! If you decide to give it a go – just to find out which side of the
fence you sit on – don’t forget to tell us all about it on
