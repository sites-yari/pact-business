Do you ever find yourself passing through Old Street tube station on a
Tuesday, thinking to yourself, ‘I wish there was a champion barista here to
serve me a cup of Pact Coffee…for free!’

Well, on [Tuesday 16th of
September](//offtherecord.frenchconnection.com/event/old-street-coffee-
morning\).) you won’t have to make such specific wishes, because [our man
Will](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/16/introducing-will/ "Introducing
Will…") will be there serving up cups of caffeinated love to all.

Basically, those lovely folks over at French Connection have a popup at Old
Street tube running from the 1st of September, through to the last day of
December. And whaddya know? They’ve asked us to help out.

So on the 16th of September, you’ll find us there all day giving away free
Pact Coffees, as made by our coffee guru, Will.

Come down and say ‘hello’, we can’t wait to see you!
