title: Espresso Martinis with Friends
---

A couple of weeks ago Stephen, Joe and I were chatting over our daily grinding
and packing session when we realised that most of our customers didn’t
appreciate how hands-on we are with every box that leaves Coffee Towers.
Shuddering at the image of vast machines and blinking lights picking and
packing your coffee we decided to do something about it, and invited a few of
our lovely members down to try their hand at the YourGrind craft. And nail a
martini or two. It was a Wednesday after all…
