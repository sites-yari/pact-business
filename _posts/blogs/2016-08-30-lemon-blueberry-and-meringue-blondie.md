With fresh notes of citrus and delicate black tea, our Ethiopian Kayon
Mountain Guji we hope will be your cup of tea – or well, coffee. So why not
have a slice of something to go with it???

With just 3 parts, don’t be daunted by the lengthy recipe as it’s still super
simple! And why not brew a cup to enjoy whilst you make it!

Recipe:

1) THE LEMON BLONDIES

**Ingredients** :

116g of soft butter

170g brown sugar

1 egg, beaten

1/2 teaspoon of vanilla

1 x 250g tub of mascarpone

2 tablespoons of lemon juice

Zest of one lemon

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1/8 teaspoon of baking soda

A pinch of salt

140g plain flour

**Method:**

– Preheat the oven to 180c.

– Lightly butter and line with greaseproof paper 2 medium size round tins.
Whisk together the room temp soft butter and sugar in a bowl.

– Add the egg and vanilla extract and whisk.

– Add the lemon juice, zest, and mascarpone cheese and mix.

– Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix it all together.

– Pour the mixture into your two pans and spread evenly. Bake for 25-30
minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool.

Time for the meringue!

2) THE MERINGUE

**Ingredients:**

4 egg whites

200g caster sugar

½ tsp cream of tartar

**Method:**

– Whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl until soft peaks form.

– Whisk in the sugar until it is smooth and glossy.

– Spoon the meringue topping onto the cooked blondie base and smooth the top
of the meringue mixture.

– Return the blondie/meringue tins to the oven for a further 25/30 minutes, or
until the meringue is golden-brown.

– Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

– Once cooled very carefully remove the cakes from the tin and set aside to
cool completely on a wire rack.

3) THE BLUEBERRY CREAM

**Ingredients:**

300ml whipping cream

100g icing sugar

100/150g blueberries

50g toasted almonds

**Method:**

– Whip the cream and icing sugar together, being careful not to over whisk.

– Remove and set aside half of the cream and fold the blueberries into one of
the halves. You basically want blueberry cream between the cake and plain
cream on top.

4) ASSEMBLE!

– Place one of the blondies meringue side down onto a plate or cake stand.
Spoon on half of the blueberry cream and smooth over.

– Then place the other blondie on top of this, blondie side down so the
meringue is on top.

– Spoon on the remainder of the cream and sprinkle with almonds.

5) CONSUME

– Brew a fresh cup of Kayon Mountain, grab yourself a slice and enjoy!
