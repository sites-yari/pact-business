Imagine this. Your job is to make brownies for a food stand. The ingredients
come to around £1.50 (you found a _great_ deal on cocoa powder!) and it also
takes a lot of your time and energy making them, too. When they’re fresh from
the oven, oozing gooey chocolate, the people that run the food stand take them
away to be sold.

Things aren’t going well at the food market, it’s just one of those days. So
they’re only selling them for a measly quid. Bargain! But since your ‘friends’
on the food stand are pocketing 50p of that each for their time, you’re left
having _paid_ 50p to buy ingredients to bake a brownie that someone else is
eating…

Sounds like one of The Apprentice challenges gone horribly, horribly wrong –
right? Well, what we’ve just described is the reality for farmers in the
commodity coffee market.

**Working hard to lose money**

The price of commodity coffee is at an incredibly awful 13-year low – coming
in at _under_ $1 per pound as of the 20th August 2018. And like your brownies,
our Head of Coffee estimates that the cost to grow coffee falls at around
$1.50 (excluding Brazil – it’s an anomaly as their production is so
efficient). What that means is, after the millers and exporters and everyone
else has had their cut, coffee farmers are paying around 50 cents to sell
their crops.

It doesn’t take a genius, or Alan Sugar, to work out that a situation like
that is neither A) sustainable, or B) fair. “But that’s where the ‘fair’ in
Fairtrade comes in, right?” you might be thinking. Well, it might surprise you
to know that all Fairtrade does is pay the difference so farmers break even.
You wouldn’t consider that a successful day’s work, would you? And neither do
we.

**How being a customer of Pact helps**

Pact Coffee makes a difference in two ways. The one you might know about is
that we are 100% committed to Direct Trade, buying straight from the source so
farmers don’t lose out to other people taking an unreasonable cut.

The other way is a little more complicated. The best way for farmers to escape
the problems with the commodity market is to get out of it. Growing and
selling speciality coffee is one way to do this, as they can get a much higher
price for their beans. But while they are paid more per pound, it also costs
more to produce. And that’s where we come in.

Pact Coffee’s Three Phase Programme is designed to bring struggling commodity
farmers into the world of speciality coffee. Firstly, we identify those
farmers that would have what it takes – given the chance. Secondly, we make
small technical investments that allow them to grow one small crop of
speciality coffee. And finally, we help them scale up by working with local
experts to work out the best way for their farm to grow – and that means more
speciality coffee for you to enjoy.

So next time you’re drinking a cup of our coffee (maybe along with one of
those brownies!) you can confidently know that no farmers have lost money from
growing these beans. Instead, you’ll know they’ve made a profit – one that’s
more-often-than-not reinvested back into their farm. Now _that’s_ sustainable.
