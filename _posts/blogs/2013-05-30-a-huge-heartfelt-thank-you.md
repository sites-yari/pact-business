title: A Huge, Heartfelt Thank You
---

Tuesday found us in a sticky spot; a planned promotion had been delayed, and
we had over 100kg of coffee ready to ship. Our 7-day freshness guarantee meant
that it was at risk of going to waste, which was not only heartbreaking but
potentially very expensive for a fledgling business.

I wrote a blog post on Tuesday morning, asking for help from some of our most
loyal customers. [You can read it
here](http://blog.yourgrind.com/post/51557478422/the-500-bag-fresh-coffee-
giveaway). Within 24 hours something remarkable had happened. 450 new users
had signed up to [YourGrind](http://www.yourgrind.com) and many have now tried
fresh-roasted coffee for the first time.

_(That’s this many):_

The whole team was in the office until 10:30pm that evening (the photo below
was taken at 9!), printing labels and stacking boxes ready for the big push
yesterday. A potentially upsetting, frustrating day was transformed into the
most exciting we have had since launching; undoubtedly the best day of my
professional life so far.

**A Big Thank You to every single member of the YourGrind community.** Thanks
to your generosity, support and kindness we shipped 78kg more than we had
expected to, and none has gone to waste.

I have been deeply moved by the events past few days. It has made me more
determined than ever to build the kind of community you can all be proud to be
a part of, and a service that makes you feel as fortunate and supported as you
have made me feel this week.

A starter for 10: **We’d love to invite you to Cosy HQ next Thursday 6th June
for an espresso martini** , and to give me a chance to thank you in person.
Just email james@yourgrind.com, and [RSVP on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/135674769963501) to let us know if
you’re coming. If there are more than 20 we may have to change the location to
somewhere bigger.

If you can’t make it this time round, or aren’t based in London, please watch
this space; we have a cunning plan…
