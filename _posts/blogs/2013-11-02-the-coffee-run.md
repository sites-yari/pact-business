Coffee and Exercise have always been a great combination, but this week we
decided to look a little further into why exactly a cup of joe makes such a
great workout companion.

More than ⅔ of olympic athletes are using caffeine to boost their performance.
Here’s 3 reasons you might want to reach for a coffee next time you’re hitting
the gym or pounding the pavements!

**1\. You’ll work out harder**

A [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124354) at Coventry University
has shown that a cup of caffeine before a workout can help you work harder and
for longer by fighting fatigue.

**2\. It’s packed with mood boosting Antioxidants**

Our bodies absorb more antioxidants from coffee than anything else, including
fruit and vegetables. Those antioxidants can also make you feel happier, it
only takes a few cups to get you in the right frame of mind for a workout

**3\. It gives you grit**

When you’re struggling to push through that tricky part of your workout, your
friend coffee will be there again helping you power through. A study
[published in The Journal of Applied
Physiology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21836046), has shown that
caffeine can reduce mental and muscle fatigue.

**So next time you need that extra edge for your workout, reach for a cup of
coffee!**
