I’m sure you’re all aware that we at Pact love to make things easier for our
dear coffee-loving customers. We’ve taken the first step by making sure you
[never run out of fresh coffee,](https://www.pactcoffee.com/about) so I
thought I’d do my part by giving you a mighty fine cake, which comes at a
fraction of the effort!

This ancient recipe, originating from France, was passed to me from Pact’s
secret packing weapon, Sarah “The Bullet” Chaillot. This French dynamo has
assured me that this recipe is so easy that children across the channel are
basically born with the ability to bake it.

“What makes it so simple?” I hear you ask. Well, the beauty of this recipe is
that the ingredient proportions are based on a single tub of yoghurt. Simply
reuse the pot to measure your remaining ingredients! The result is a
beautifully soft and simple dessert that you can whip up in a flash, just in
time for your mid-morning coffee!

**About the yoghurt pot:** A standard pot is 150g but the beauty of the recipe
is that it’s pretty much all in proportion. So if you start with a slightly
bigger or a smaller pot then you’ll make a slightly bigger or smaller cake!

**Ingredients**

1 pot of yogurt (any will do, Greek, vanilla, blueberry etc.)  
2 pots of sugar  
3 pots of flour  
1/2 pot of melted butter  
3 eggs  
1 tsp baking powder  
Your choice of flavour (we used frozen berries and a dash of almond essence)

**Method**

1\. Prepare by setting your oven to 200°C/gas mark 6 and greasing a cake tin.
We used a springform tin, but any type is fine.  
2\. Combine all ingredients (except the fruit) and mix well.  
3\. Fold in the fruit and flavour.  
4\. Place in the oven for about 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the
centre comes out clean.  
5\. Place a jaunty beret atop your head and pour a healthy dose of au lait for
your [Pact café](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)! Bon appétit!
