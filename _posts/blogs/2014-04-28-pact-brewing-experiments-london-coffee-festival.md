title: Pact Brewing Experiments (London Coffee Festival)
---

In the same week that the London Coffee Festival took place, we decided to get
involved in the fun with some events of our own. We held three different open-
evenings called; “Brewing Experiments: Coffee Without the Snobbery”, which
focussed on the India Bibi and were free to attend for our customers. Here’s
how it went down…

**What happened?** We did four different brewing experiments, exploring which
brew type – [aeropress](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/aeropress-
brewing-guide/ "Aeropress Brewing Guide"),
[cafetiere](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/04/02/cafetiere-brew-guide-2/
"Cafetiere Brew Guide"), [V60](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/26/pour-
over-brewing-guide-v60/ "Pour Over Brewing Guide \(V60\)") or
[stovetop](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/24/stovetop-brewing-guide/
"Stovetop Brewing Guide") – worked best for [India
Bibi](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/26/an-interview-with-bibi-our-latest-
coffee/ "An interview with Bibi – our latest coffee"). For each one someone
got to test their brewing skills up against Pete, our coffee aficionado.

and Callum doing their stuff with Bibi.

**Who was there?** A whole load of Pact customers, including a range of ages
and backgrounds. We had everyone from neuroscientists to lawyers, Kiwis to
Cockneys – there was even one father-son combo. It was great to meet so many
customers, including those who have been with us from the start and those
who’ve only been getting deliveries for a couple of weeks.

**What did everyone think of Bibi?** The overall impression was that Bibi is
really tasty but perhaps more importantly, versatile. Previous cupping
sessions have tended to show that certain coffees are particularly suited to
certain brew types but with Bibi they all tasted pretty ruddy good.

“Can I get a cafeti-yeah?”

**What were the high points?** According to the feedback we collected,
everyone seemed to love trying different brew methods without having to invest
in all the equipment. Picking up little tips about things like coffee to water
ratio helped to make the often-intimidating world of coffee feel easy to
digest.

**When is the next event at Pact HQ?** In a couple of week’s time, so keep
your eyes peeled!
