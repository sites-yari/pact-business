Having a naturally talented coffee roaster at the helm of our London Grind
House is very important to how Pact’s coffee turns out. We roast much lighter
than what you’re likely to find on the high street. This allows the natural
sweetness in the coffee to really shine through. When roasters roast dark, it
is often to mask the natural flavours and create an easily reproducible
product. Because we source beans directly from farms and farmers we trust and
support, we want those unique flavours to shine through.

> “One degree can make a huge difference to the taste of the coffee.”

Our roasts are done in small batches in London, under Aissa’s watchful eye.
Before each roast a sample of the batch roasted and cupped to ensure it’s up
to our high standards. Aissa works alongside Will, our head of Coffee, to make
sure each batch is living up to it’s true potential. If it passes, into the
roaster it goes! Each kind of bean will have a unique roast profile, so it can
be quite hectic roasting all of our coffees each day. It’s that attention
detail that gets the best out the beans.

All this in service of you, our perfect Pacter. Our fuss over freshness means
we’ll never send you coffee we’re not happy with. So when you get your coffee,
you’ll can rest assured that Aissa won’t let you down.
