Pact is a coffee startup run by 12 coffee-loving friends. We are passionate
about making our customers’ lives better by introducing them to fresh coffee,
and delighting them whenever we’re given the opportunity.

As we’ve grown, we’ve faced new challenges. We moved out of my dining room and
into our first Grown-Up Office back in February, when a busy day meant sending
25 bags of coffee after a looong queue at the Post Office.

Pact is a different place today – we’re regularly shipping 1,000 packs of
coffee in a day and are growing faster by the day. It’s exciting, but there is
more to juggle than ever before. Previously infrequent tasks like hiring,
finance, promotions and office admin are a daily occurrence, and we need the
right person to help us keep up!

Working closely with the CEO, your role will be part office management, HR and
PA. The best job description is to keep the business running, even when old
coffee grounds hit the fan.

The ideal candidate will be bright, focussed and productive under their own
steam. Not afraid to challenge the team to be better, and equally happy to be
challenged. Ambitious, resilient, highly organised and more likely to focus
rather than fold under pressure.

If this sounds like you we’d love to hear from you. Please send a CV and cover
letter to [stephen@pactcoffee.com](mailto:stephen@pactcoffee.com).
(Applications from Pact members will always be read first, so be sure to send
them from the email address you used to sign up!)
