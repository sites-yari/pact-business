For International Coffee Day, here at Pact, we’ve gathered together for a very
special “Coffee Bake-Off” organised in honour of our favourite show – The
Great British Bake-Off. We’re challenging you, our customers, to enter your
best coffee-based recipes to win a fabulous Pact prize!

Do you need some recipe inspiration for the big day? We’ve got your back!
George Blower, Coffee Manager during the weekday and master chef on the
weekend, has created a list of coffee recipes especially for you.

But don’t let that hold you back, we love creative new twists on classic
recipes (coffee pannacotta anyone?) or something crazier if you’d prefer: be
creative!

Here are George’s recipes to get you started:

  * [Coffee Shortbread](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/09/27/coffee-shortbread/)
  * [Coffee and Walnut cake](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/09/27/coffee-walnut-cake/)
  * [Coffee Meringues](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/09/27/coffee-meringues/)
