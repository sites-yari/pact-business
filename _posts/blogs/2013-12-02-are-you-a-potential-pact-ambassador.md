title: Are you a potential Pact Ambassador?
---

Are you passionate about great coffee? Are you a fan of what we’re doing here
at Pact? Do you often find yourself talking to friends and family about the
merits of good, fresh coffee? Then you could be just the person we’re looking
for to become one of our new Pact Ambassadors…

**What’s involved?**

This is a fledgeling project at the moment but we’re after engaged members of
our community to help bring people better coffee. We’d love for our
Ambassadors to:

– share your wealth of coffee knowledge by writing articles for our blog,

– shout about your love for Pact,

– organise educational events for local coffee fans, such as preparation
classes and tastings,

– arrange social events for coffee-lovers near you, including things like
coffee shop ‘crawls’ where you discover great local coffee shops,

– help shape the Ambassador programme with ideas and feedback about what works
and what doesn’t.

**What’s in it for you?**

We will provide you with what you’ll need to run your own little coffee-
appreciation society. We’ll send you some great Pact merchandise, goods and
resources – and of course all the beans you’ll need to host some seriously
good coffee love-ins.

You’ll also be invited to exclusive Pact Ambassador events, cuppings and get
the chance to meet lots of fellow coffee-lovers near you. Plus, by being the
voice of Pact community, you will have a chance to profoundly affect the
future of Pact itself.

**Requirements:**
