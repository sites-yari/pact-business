[![Pact Coffee Biscuit
Pairing](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/biscuits-

blog.jpg)Some pairings just make sense, like Lennon and McCartney or Holmes
and Watson. And then some parings not only make sense, they come into your
life and make your day instantly better. Coffee and biscuits for example.

As you can imagine, we’re a big bunch of dunkers here at Pact HQ. If there’s a
biscuit around, you can guarantee we’re dipping it in our coffee. But is it
possible some biscuits are better suited to certain coffees? Being the
clinical coffee drinkers we are, we just had to do a test to find out.

After we pilfered our local off license’s supply of Fig Rolls, Nice biscuits,
Hobnobs, Malted Milks and Bourbon Creams we prepped some of our current
coffees. We set to work dipping and sipping with:

  * A cafetiere of [Decaffeinated San Antonio](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) (kept black)
  * A flat white made from [Fig Pudding Espresso ](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)
  * A V60 of [Fazenda Grota Funda](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) (also black)

**Decaffeinated San Antonio: Natural dunker vs. A Nice pair**  
The Decaf San Antonio needed a little creaminess to cut through its orange
acidity, which the fig rolls offered in spades. We know, they’re not natural
dunkers, but it kind of works. The Nices were also an excellent match, and
their added ability to hold form after a good dousing made them the winner.

**Fig Pudding Espresso: Speed is critical  
** Well, aren’t we just a popular little biscuit? The Nice went perfectly with
the Fig Pudding Espresso. It seems the no-frills creaminess of the Nice
biscuit makes it a very good accompaniment. It was noted, however, that dunk
time had to be precise. Too long and the biscuit is lost in the cup. Too short
and it wouldn’t absorb any of the coffee flavour.

**Sitio Sao Benedito: Loves a Bourbon Cream**  
Brewed in a V60, the creamy mouthfeel of the Sitio Sao Benedito found its mate
in the Bourbon Cream. The simple elegant coffee flavour was complemented
marvellously by the biscuit’s plucky boldness. What’s the saying about
opposites attracting?

**Hobnob Disclaimer:**  
Now, I know what you’re thinking. Where are the chocolate Hobnobs in all of
this? I’ll tell you where: they’re everywhere. When it comes to dunking,
Hobnobs come up trumps. This cookie jar classic was a bit of a wildcard, and
could be dipped or dunked in any brew with delicious results.

Malted Milks on the other hand were, well, to be frank, a bit rubbish. The
simple taste was drowned (pun intended) in the coffee. Maybe more of a tea
biscuit?
