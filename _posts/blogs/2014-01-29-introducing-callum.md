Though many of you may have crossed paths with him by now, we thought it was
worth giving a Callum our (relatively) new Customer Champion a little
welcoming fanfare.

Here’s a note from the man himself…

– Pact Customer Champion

_Hey Pacters!_

_My name’s Callum and I’ve joined the team to help Pete with Customer Service
and Community, although I’m looking forward to mucking in with everything! I
actually just finished a degree in Philosophy, so I’m hoping to bring some
deep, contemplative thought and debate into Pact HQ…!_

_I have always been a big coffee fan, so I was immediately drawn to Pact and I
must say it is the best-smelling office I have ever worked in. Helping people
out at the same time as learning more about coffee is a pretty nice way to
spend a working day._

_Pete has already built a great reputation for Pact’s Customer Service and I
know he always tries to go one step beyond in helping people with their
queries and to get the best from their coffee. I hope I can do the same, so
please don’t hesitate to get in touch (either through[the Pact
website](http://support.pactcoffee.com/knowledgebase) or directly at
[callum@pactcoffee.com](mailto:callum@pactcoffee.com)). I know lots of
companies say this, but we really do appreciate any comments and feedback you
send in, as we’re always looking to improve what we do._

_I look forward to hearing from you.  
__Callum_

**A quick Q &A with Callum:**

**What does your favourite mug look like?**  
It’s red and it has the words ‘Coffee makes my day more beautiful.’ on it.
It’s from my mum and she’d be very upset if I didn’t choose that one.

**What is your favourite time of day to drink coffee?**  
The morning. Or to be more specific, Saturday morning, that way I can take my
time to make it right. And I’ll have Saturday Kitchen on. Obviously.

**Do you happen to have any coffee-related nuggets of philosophical wisdom to
share with us?**  
I do as it goes. One of my favourite philosophers, Bertrand Russell, once said
“Life is just one cup of coffee after another, and don’t look for anything
else.”
