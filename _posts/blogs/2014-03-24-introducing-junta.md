[![Junta Pact Coffee
Team](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/junta.png?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/junta.png)If
you found out about us through Twitter or Facebook, chances are you have Junta
to thank. He’s something of a Tweet-freak and loves nothing more than finding
people who are into coffee and letting them know that we exist.

Since joining Pact, Junta has brought a lot of energy into the company. He’s
currently trying to organise a team cycle to Rye and regularly breaks up his
working day with a quick bosh on [The Arch Climbing
Wall](http://archclimbingwall.com/) right under Pact HQ. So let’s find out a
little more about the man behind the Tweets…

**What do you do at Pact?**  
I look for new customers online, particularly on social media.

**What’s your favourite part of the working day (please don’t say home
time)?**  
Checking in to catch up on the pictures customers have
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee) in. I also like it when Felix opens
his daily packet of chocolate digestives.

**Tell us a bit about where you worked previously?**  
I’ve been working in advertising agencies for a few years. In my most recent
agency I worked with a lot of start-up clients and caught the bug.

**What is it about Pact that made you want to work here?**  
I loved Pact’s frank tone of voice and the super slick UX of the website.

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**  
Apathy.

Nightmare](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apathy.jpg?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apathy.jpg)

**What’s your preferred brew method?**  
I use a cafetiere if I have company or an aeropress if I’m just making a
coffee for myself (so easy). Also, I recently bought a Hario hand grinder
which took three weeks to arrive from Japan. After all the anticipation I was
outraged at how much effort it takes to grind beans by hand but now it’s
become a morning ritual that I look forward to. It feels respectful to the
bean and a pleasurable way of making coffee.

**What does your favourite mug look like?**  
It’s huge and has two handles on either side! I’m not sure if you still call
it a mug at that size. It’s more of a soup bowl.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**  
[The Austin Powers Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClyD7DjSVe8).

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**  
The ability to shoot spider webs from my wrists.
