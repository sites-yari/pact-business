In September at Pact HQ, a ‘fresh fashion statement’ meant [sack-
shorts](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/09/17/pact-sack-style/ "Pact Sack
Style"). But trends change quickly here, so in October the only garment to be
seen in is a limited edition ‘Love Fresh Coffee’ T-shirt:

This most excellent garment has been designed by our very own Anneliese (whose
fashion resume includes Burberry if you don’t mind) and printed just 300
times.

So, how can you make this the latest addition to your carefully curated
T-shirt collection?

**For the month of October we’ll be sending a limited edition T-shirt  
****to Pact customers** **who encourage three friends to sign up for a £1 bag
