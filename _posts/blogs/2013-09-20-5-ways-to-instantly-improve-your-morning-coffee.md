This week we’re getting a bit scientific here at Pact, and we’ve put together
a little guide with some top tips how to get the perfect cup of coffee!

1\. Store your coffee in a cool dark place, you can keep it in an airtight jar
or the bag we ship it to you in. Why not the fridge? Because moving it in and
out creates condensation in the bag, that can damage the coffee.

2\. Use filtered water whenever brewing. Tap water contains chlorine and other
chemicals which can affect the taste of your coffee. They’ll also damage your
coffee making equipment over time, so it’s best to just filter them out!

3\. Fresh roasted is best! There’s a reason we roast and ship our coffee to
you at the last possible moment, is because the freshness doesn’t last long
(coffee can start going stale about a month after it’s roasted and ground).
Supermarket stuff is usually stale, as it was roasted 6-12 months before you
buy it. [Click here if you’d like to try a bag of our fresh roasted coffee,
for just £1](https://www.pactcoffee.com/signup/introduce?voucher=sofresh)

4\. The Golden Ratio for coffee is 60g per litre of water – that’s about one
heaped tablespoon per cup. But remember, it’s also about personal taste, so
experiment with making it a little stronger or weaker!

5\. It’s all about personal taste! There are a lot of coffees out there that
won’t be your cup of tea, some people prefer strong flavours, others prefer
something lighter and more acidic. At Pact we have at least 5 coffees on
rotation at any time, so if you’d like to be adventurous and experiment with
some different types, you can ask us to send you one here:
