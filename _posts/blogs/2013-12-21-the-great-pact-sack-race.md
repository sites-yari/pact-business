title: The Great Pact Sack Race
---

It’s been an exciting past couple of weeks at Pact HQ, spreading festive cheer
and ending the year with a bumper day of coffee shipments. We topped it all
off with our Christmas Party, and our long-awaited Coffee Sack Race…

The race was to clear the finish line in the shortest time, and we held it
just outside our office. Our participants Tony, Josie, Felix and Sam were
dressed to impress with some rather excellent headwear, as they geared
themselves up to see who would be crowned winner of such a prestigious event.

We had lot’s of fun and wanted to share it with you all, who do you think will
win?

Merry Christmas from the Pact Team x
