**Stef, one of the Pact HQ lovelies, recently read that coffee grounds can be
the basis for a great natural exfoliant. As a small legal disclaimer, if this
post results in you looking a bit scary for an hour or two then it’s
officially Stef’s fault. That said, we’ve given it a whirl and it seems like
those unwanted grounds of yours could give your skin a nice peachy soft
glow…**

This recipe comes from Natural Living Ideas and is apparently a great way of
giving your skin a boost while making use of old coffee grounds.

  1. Take two tablespoons of used coffee grounds and pop them in a bowl for mixing.
  2. Add an equal amount of organic cocoa powder.
  3. Mix in three tablespoons of whole milk or heavy cream.
  4. Top it off with a tablespoon of honey and apply.
  5. Use warm water to rinse the mask off after ten minutes or so.

Any leftover coffee scrub can be popped into the fridge, where it can be
stored for several days.

**#coffeescrub option 2:**

If you’re tight on time or dubious about a coffee scrub being a good idea,
there’s an easier way to give it a try. Instead of making a mask as above,
apparently (according to Stef) you can simply mix coffee grounds in with your
usual facewash to give it some extra exfoliating oomph. Here’s what it’ll look
like:

I found this made my skin feel squeaky clean but it’s pretty thorough so I’d
only do it every couple of weeks. My other top tip is to put a coffee filter
over your plughole to avoid blocking your drains!
