title: Ever Dreamed Of Being A Coffee Buyer? Try This Friday!
---

Early last month we caused a bit of a stir when we announced the newest member
of our team, Nick. As Head of Coffee, it’s his job to make sure we’re
constantly delighting you guys with the best coffee around. This caused a bit
of a stir on Twitter, with a few of you suggesting it was the best job in the
world.

So he’s decided it would be selfish to keep it to himself, and would love your
help choosing and buying in our next bean.

This Friday, we have 5 Colombian single-origin coffees being delivered to the
office for a tasting session. These light, bright little fellas are in high-
demand at the moment, and we’re going to have to swoop quickly once we find
the bean we love.
