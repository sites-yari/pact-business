**Freshly ground  
** There’s a reason why we grind your Pact Coffee at the last possible moment,
and it comes down to one word: freshness. Basically, coffee tastes best when
it’s freshly ground. Getting Pact to grind your coffee for you is a great way
to maintain that great, fresh taste, but if you’re keen to step it up a notch,
it’s surprisingly easy to grind your coffee at home.

**Even more freshly ground  
** Home grinding has always been a bit of a minefield. I am regularly asked
questions about people’s home grinders, grind settings and for recommendations
on which grinder to invest in. I think it’s a common misconception that
grinders need to cost a lot of money, but it’s not the case. Hand grinders can
actually be an inexpensive tool, and go miles towards getting the most from
your beans.

**Meet the Rhino  
** Unlike its animal namesake, this kit is pretty compact. Amazingly though,
it can also hold up to 40g of beans – enough to brew two big mugs of coffee.
The Rhino also has the ability to adjust the grind size, so you can grid to
suit a whole range of brewing kits.

I’m not the kind of guy to recommend something without trying it out, so we
held a Pact HQ roadtest. We found that it takes just a minute and a half to
grind enough beans for an Aeropress, which is about as long as it takes a
kettle to boil. And the resulting grinds were excellent.

Needless to say, I think the Rhino is awesome and I think you will be too. It
is available from [CoffeeHit](http://www.coffeehit.co.uk).

****PSST…** if you pick up a Rhino, don’t forget to [**change your Pact
