title: The story of our Limited Edition Coffees.
---

In our experience, coffee is all about temptation. And even though Will, our
Head of Coffee, is a professional, he’s not immune to the lure of a really,
really good coffee. And that’s how Pact’s Limited Edition Coffees was born…

your limits.  
** The number of people we send out coffee to is growing all the time. That’s
something we find exciting. But it’s also something that requires lots of
planning. To ensure that everyone gets the chance to try the coffees on our
**[Pact Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=limitededition&utm_campaign=20141117blog)** , Will needs to
order a minimum number of sacks. At the moment that minimum is 20 sacks.

**Then something special comes along.  
** Setting limits is all well and good but sometimes Will encounters and falls
in love with a coffee from a small farm, where there’s no way he can get hold
of the minimum number of sacks. Up until recently he’s found it heartbreaking
to turn down such good coffee…

**Hello Limited Edition Coffee!  
** The solution was to give Will a lifeline, so that each month he could break
his own rule and add a coffee to the menu where fewer than 20 sacks are
available. We call it Limited Edition Coffee. Will calls it a coffee-buyer’s
dream.

So watch out for Will’s specially selected Limited Edition Coffees each month:

  * They come in little black bags rather than the usual brown.
  * They cost a bit extra (usually £2).
  * They’re never around for long…
