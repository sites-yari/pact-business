[![El Carmen Tasting Pact
Coffee](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tasting1.jpg?w=153)](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/el-
carmen)When we introduced [Fazenda
Sertaozinho](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/06/a-taste-test-for-fazenda-
sertaozinho/ "A taste test for Fazenda Sertãozinho…") last week, we got a kick
out of rolling up our sleeves for an impromptu cupping session at Pact HQ. In
fact, we had so much fun we decided to try it again with our new coffee from
El Salvador, El Carmen.

We already had some tasting notes down – it’s medium-bodied with a bright
citrus acidity, that packs a juicy punch – but in the interest of research
(and a love of coffee, of course), we decided to test it with some different
brew methods.

So we got all the team involved, and even put a shout out to our Pact
customers on [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/PactCoffee)and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee). A new customer called Dan (a lovely
chap indeed!) and a Jack Russell named Chuck dropped in and helped us out with
round two of our shoot-from-the-hip cupping sessions.

**Cafetiere  
** We kicked off with the cafetiere.
[Pete](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/07/11/introducing-pete-customer-
service-community/) immediately declared: “ _It has big body”._ A statement
that was greeted with (perhaps slightly bemused if agreeable) nods. “Big body”
is a little hard to decipher when you’re learning, but we were all definitely
in agreement about the strong fruit acidity. We were off to a juicy start!

**V60  
** Next we tried the V60. This method produces a much clearer-looking coffee
and this clarity was noticeable in the taste. It was a far more pronounced
flavour, which [Callum](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/29/introducing-
callum/) likened to marzipan. There was a suggestion from the rabble that
perhaps they could taste unripened strawberries.[![Pact Coffee El Carmen

**Stovetop  
** It was the stovetop method that drew the biggest gasps of approval. The
flavour was full and strong. Felix proclaimed with delight: “ _it’s like
having a shot of vodka!”_ (we think he meant the exhilarating kick of the
flavour). This was when our guest Dan chimed in (he’s a very quick learner): “
_I can definitely taste green apples.”_ The strength of the flavour was so
unexpected, there was group speculation on how milk would affect the taste.
Which brings us to…

**Stovetop with Milk  
** What a change! The strength stayed put but the acidity mellowed
immediately. All the bitterness was muted, bringing out what
[I](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/14/introducing-georgia/ "Introducing…
Georgia") thought was a more savoury caramel taste. A bit like roasted
vegetables. We were so blown away by the transition we brewed another stovetop
so everyone could have another helping.

**Aeropress  
** The shorter brew time combined with the clarity of a V60 hit the coffee
sweet spot with most of the crowd, so much so that quite a few of us declared
it was the favourite. There was a general consensus that the flavour found a
perfect balance of acid and bitterness.

Fancy conducting your own taste test at home?
