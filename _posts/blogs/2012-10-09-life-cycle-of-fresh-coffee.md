title: Life cycle of fresh coffee
---

We always ship our coffee 5-21 days after it’s been roasted. You may be
wondering why! It’s not complicated, but it is a cruicial part of drinking
good coffee, and is all too often overlooked by chain coffee shops and
supermarkets.

_Green Coffee_

Before roasting, coffee beans are a pale green colour. The picture below was
taken on my iPhone, and is the coffee we’re shipping as I type, before it’s
been roasted. Green coffee is pretty stable when stored right, and the flavor
profile will not change for 6 or even 12 months.

_Here comes the science…_

The magic starts when green coffee is roasted. Roasting causes a number of
reactions, not least the caramelisation of sugars and release of flavor oils.

Roasting also creates a lot of CO2, which seeps slowly out of the coffee for a
few weeks. As this CO2 is lost, it takes with it a number of the more volatile
flavor oils that give each coffee it’s unique taste. That said, coffee is too
acidic to drink in the first few days after roasting; a period of rest (known
as degasing) is needed.

In addition, exposure to the air causes various compounds in roasted coffee to
oxidise, which causes the stale, flat taste I would associate with supermarket
blends.

In summary, **Coffee gets less sexy with time**.

_The timeframe:_

We always ship our coffee between day 5 and 21, when it’s ‘Charlie Sheen’.
Supermarket coffee tends to reach the shelves 6-8 weeks after roasting, when
it’s decidedly ‘Ken Livingstone.’

Before day 7 you’ll find most coffee is acidic and unpalatable – it needs that
first week to degas. Shipping by day 21 means that you will still have enough
time to enjoy it at home before it loses its laugh.
