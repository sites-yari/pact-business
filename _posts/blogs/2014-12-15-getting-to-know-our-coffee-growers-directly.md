title: Getting to know our coffee-growers directly.
---

On the face of it, the decision for a coffee company to work with coffee-
growers directly seems like an obvious one. But here at Pact we were unable to
do this when we were small. To put it simply, we weren’t selling enough coffee
to cover the cost of a plane ticket, for someone to go out there and shop for
coffee.

However things have changed since we launched and Will (our Head of Coffee)
has now been on coffee-sourcing missions to both Guatemala and Brazil. By the
end of 2015 we hope to have imported 50 different coffees for our [Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=directsourcing&utm_campaign=20141208blog), all bought directly
from farmers all over the coffee-growing world. To give you an idea of what
those farmers are like, here’s a little Q&A with two of our guys out in
Guatemala…

**Farm: Chalabal Estrella.  
****Owner: Alfredo Amenábar  
****Location: Acatenango, Guatemala**

**Did you buy the farm?  
** No, it’s belonged to my family since 1930.

**What about your farm are you most proud of?  
** The quality of the coffee and that 30 per cent of our farm is natural
reserve.

**Tell us something about your farm that you could only know by working there…  
** There’s a lot of peace, watching the Acatenango Volcano erupt under the sky
full of stars.

**Who are the biggest characters on your farm?  
** The Saints of Chalabal, these “saints” are actually two big rocks that are
at the top of a rocky mountain, and when you are at the farm they look like
two people that are watching over our farm.

**What do you and your workers usually eat for lunch?  
** Tortillas and black beans.

**What’s the highlight of your day?  
** We are very happy with our little plantation of avocados that we started
planting today.

**What do you do once you’ve finished work for the day?  
** Play soccer with the workers and making little gardens.

**What’s your favourite sports team?  
** The soccer team of Chalabal Estrella farm.

**Where’s your favourite place to relax on the farm?  
** The hallway of the house, where you can watch the Acatenango Volcano.

**Farm : San Julian  
****Owner: Inversiones Mimosa S.A.  
****Location: Palencia, Guatemala**

**What’s the appeal of working with Pact?  
** Starting a relationship with Pact, England, wow. Our coffee going to Europe
has been one of our dreams. You just made it happen. And for that we are very
thankful to you.

**What about your farm are you most proud of?  
** To have four consecutive Cup of Excellence awards, 2009-2012. That is a
miracle, and I’m proud of that, very proud.

**What do you and your workers usually eat for lunch?  
** For lunch we eat different kinds of meals. Some of our employees love to
drink Coca Cola, others prefer drinking fresh milk out of the cow. Well, that
is a different experience. Me personally I pass. But our people love it.

**What’s the biggest ambition for your farm?  
** To make you laugh a little bit, well I would love to have a coffee
commercial for the PGA Tour. Can you imagine to have a commercial for our
farm, our coffee? Very few have achieved this, but is possible. Everything is
possible.

**What’s your favourite sports team?  
** NFL my sports team is the Tampa Buccaneers. In NBA I like Miami Heat. In
PGA Golf I enjoy watching Bubba Watson, great guy.

**Where’s your favourite place to relax on the farm?  
** At the end of the day I love to go to the upper part of the farm. 6,280
feet above sea level. Especially in November. The view is spectacular. We can
see the three volcanoes and the city lights.
