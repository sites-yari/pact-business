**Dear Brendan,**

**When it comes to matters of coffee and love, I’ve never been fussy. It’s
rare that I meet a bean I don’t like, which is why I decided to let Pact set
me up on blind dates with my coffees.**

**I’m usually happy to let the experts choose – and I’ve been set up with some
absolute beauties – but this time the spark just wasn’t there. Basically, my
most recent bag of Pact and I just didn’t hit it off. I don’t want to hurt
anyone’s feelings, but I’d rather spend my time with a coffee that suits my
tastes. How can I make a change, without it getting awkward?**

**Sincerely,**

**Not my flavour match.**

Hi there, ** **  
****

I’m sorry to hear you and your coffee didn’t find a love match, but not to
worry. Seeking help is the first step towards finding the right coffee for
you. Now that you’ve made that leap, there are a couple of things you can do
from here.

**Rate your coffee:** If you don’t like that coffee, give it the thumbs down
on your Pact Account Page. It sounds harsh, but it’ll ensure you don’t get
that coffee again.

**Talk it out:** It’s good to get some perspective from a third party, so try
calling or emailing Callum and the rest of the Customer Service team at Pact.
Like Will Smith in the film _Hitch_ , they just love playing matchmaker.

You can’t help who (or which coffee) you fall in love with, but these small
actions will lead you to your next perfect match.

Happy brewing,

Brendan
