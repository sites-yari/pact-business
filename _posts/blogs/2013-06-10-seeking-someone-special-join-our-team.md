YourGrind.com is a small company run by 5 friends who are passionate about
making our customers’ lives better. It’s not just about great coffee, roasted
within 7 days of shipping (though that is pretty key!) but the whole
experience and that includes customer service. We take every customer question
seriously, and take incredible pride in every single interaction we have, be
it via email, phone, Twitter or in person at YourGrind HQ.

As we’ve grown, we’ve faced new challenges. We moved out of my dining room and
into our first Grown Up Office back in February, when a busy day meant sending
25 bags of coffee after a looong queue at the Post Office. We’re now regularly
sending 300 before the first collection at 3:30pm, and are growing faster than
ever. (Scaling our technology has posed interesting problems too, though
that’s one for another blog post…)

Customer Service has thrown a few curve balls too. Lots of organisations seem
to place great customer care far down their list of priorities (especially for
existing, rather than new customers!) but at YourGrind we couldn’t take it
more seriously. As the inbox gets busier, we have had to think creatively
about how to ensure that every customer who asks us a question is not only
satisfied with the response, but delighted. That may be where you come in.

**We’re looking for our first Customer Champion** ; someone who is as excited
by our journey as we are, and wants to come along for the ride. You’ll be
responsible for handling all our customer interactions, good and bad, and
ensuring that our level of customer care is as good as the coffee we’re
sending out. You can do this from home if you’re outside London, so the role
is open to any one of our subscribers.

The perfect person is:

– Looking for a challenge – we like to push the boundaries of what is possible
in everything we do

– A YourGrind customer

– Optimistic, enthusiastic and professional

– Eloquent, intelligent and highly organised

– A problem-solver who’s able to make decisions

If you’re interested in joining YourGrind, pop us an email or give us a call
and have a chat. We’d really love to hear from you.
