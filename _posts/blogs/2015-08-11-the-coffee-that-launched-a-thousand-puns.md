Well, technically it wasn’t 1,000, but when the delightful Bibi Plantation
from the Coorg Hills of Southern India [returned to our
menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/login) recently our Twitter lit up
with some seriously punny behaviour. If you’ll allows us to break it down
play-by-play.

#### What started with a Tweet and a little giveaway…

It seems Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are an inspirational pair because,
well…

#### It quickly escalated to full mullet…

And in case the risk of accidentally catching an “Achy Breaky” earworm wasn’t
great enough, we soon received another round of revised classics in the form
of **“Bibi Got Back”,** **“Don’t You Want Me, Bibi?”,** **“Bibi Did A Bad, Bad
Thing”**. (Although, we know that last one isn’t true because Bibi Plantation
is a good, good thing).

#### And then there was this:

It quickly became apparent that the people of Twitter are very pre-occupied
with ’80s and ’90s pop cultural references. Who knew?

#### Despite this, it was very hard to ignore just how highbrow everyone can
be…

(We’re positive Bill Shakespeare would have given this appropriation his stamp
of approval.)
