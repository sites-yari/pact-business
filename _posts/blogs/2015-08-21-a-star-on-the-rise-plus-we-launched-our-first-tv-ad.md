#### This is Matt (well, a corner of Matt’s head).

Officially, he’s our Operations Manager. Unofficially, he’s Pact’s resident
model-slash-star on the rise. We like to snap pictures of him whenever we can.
And you can see why! He’s very photogenic.

####  Here’s a picture of his hands having a coffee with Pohlin’s hands.

(She’s a star too…)

#### Matt’s arms holding several bags of Pact at once!

His devotion to his craft is impressive to say the least.

I guess what we’re trying to say is, Matt’s worked at Pact for nearly two
years and we seem to have collected innumerable photos of his very eye-
catching arms, hands and forehead. Until now.

In case you missed it, we just launched our very first TV ad this week and
Matt did us the honour of featuring his entire body in it!

It was his television debut and we think he did a great job (even if he did
insist of having a fresh tropical fruit platter in his rider). Give it a watch
and tell us what you think! We’re campaigning for an Oscar, but we’ll settle
for BAFTA.
