title: The YourGrind Fairytale Makeover
---

~~~

_Once upon a time there was a plucky little website called YourGrind. Whilst
he was young and naïve, he was a dreamer, and knew that one day he would know
what it felt to be loved, if only he could catch people’s eye._

_Then one day an enchanted codesman – whose name was Joe – came along and
promised to grant the hopeful young website one wish. You guessed it, the
website wished to be gorgeous._

_So after a lot of help from YourGrind’s friends, careful thought, and a few
all-nighters from the good-hearted Joe, the plain old website was
transformed!_

You can now see the fruits of Joe’s labour at [YourGrind.com
>](http://www.yourgrind.com)

What’s new?

As well as a new look we think we’ve clarified what’s on offer. So we’ve now
got super little sections on:

[Our coffee](http://www.yourgrind.com) [Delivery](http://www.yourgrind.com)
[Choice](http://www.yourgrind.com) [Ethics](http://www.yourgrind.com)

… and that’s just the homepage!

As far as our members are concerned we’re now rocking a cleaner, clearer
design all over the site and we’ve paid particular attention to [your
account](https://www.yourgrind.com/login) functions. It’s now easy as pie to:

  * See what coffee is available
  * Select the coffee you’d like to try
  * Pause your orders if you’re off on your jollies
  * Change your delivery address
  * Amend your billing details

What’s special?

All the changes we’ve made have been suggested by members of our community.
It’s you who uses the website, so it seemed fair to let you have your say on
how it works. Since the makeover suggestions were 100% user-generated we’d
like to say a great, big, capitalised thank you to everyone who contributed:
THANK YOU!

What’s it to me?

Well we hope that we’ve given you a website to be proud of. Proud enough to
tell a friend about. Just as you would only matchmake a friend with avery
snazzy date, you would only want to recommend very snazzy site to them. We get
that.

(And they all lived happily after.)
