title: Help us to name our new grinder!
---

_“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose_  
_By any other name would smell as sweet.”_

Juliet Montague clearly didn’t think much of names but here at Pact HQ we do.
That’s why we name all [The unsung heroes of the Pact Packing
Room](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/12/the-unsung-heroes-of-the-pact-
packing-room/ "The unsung heroes of The Pact Packing Room").

It’s a mark of respect really. After all, without our grinders (Betty and R.
Kelly), weighing machine (Weigh-n Campbell) and heat sealers (Heat Ledger and
Ce-sealia), our top quality coffee wouldn’t be half as delicious by the time
it reaches you. So, now that there’s going to be a new grinder in town – a
Mahlkönig no less – it’s time we got our thinking caps on.

These are the best potential names we’ve come up with for our newest recruit.
Do you think any of them are right? We’d love for you to vote for your
favourite or add your own suggestion…

[polldaddy poll=8024768]

**Note:** When the votes were counted on the 10th of July, LeAnn Grinds was a
stand-out winner. We duly filed the paperwork with the local register office,
ordered headed notepaper and set up LeAnn with her own business cards. Little
did we realise that we’d left the poll open and people were continuing to
vote! Public opinion seems to be against Leanne now but we have to respect her
as a grinder and stick with the result from the 10th. We hope that doesn’t
come as too much of a disappointment for fans of Sir Ranulph Grinds and
Benedict Grindabatch.
