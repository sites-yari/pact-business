title: Cold brew vs. Iced coffee
---

**When summer comes around you know it’s time to raise your chilled coffee
game. But as far as chilled coffee goes, which hip-hop camp are you part of,
Ice Cube or L.L. Cold Brew? Try out the methods below to see where your
allegiance lies…**

**L.L. Cold Brew  
** The principle behind cold brew is that cold water has less energy to
extract flavour from the grounds and so it needs longer to do its thing. The
coffee needs to be immersed in the water for a while, so this only really
works with cafetieres or in the Mizudashi Coffee Pot by Hario. The main thing
to remember is that it needs to be left to brew in the fridge for at least 12
hours, so preparation is everything.

HOW: Brew your coffee as you usually would but using room temperature water.
You’re going to need a ratio of 7:1 of water to coffee, so for a litre of
water you’ll need around 140g of coffee. Stir it up before popping it in the
fridge to brew. Then decant and enjoy. Again milk can be added if you fancy
something creamy, and if you’re after a bit of sweetness you can mix in some
sugar syrup (sugar dissolved in hot water) or agave syrup.

HOW LONG: Anything between 12 and 36 hours.

RESULTS: This produces a crystal clear, refreshing cup with delicate flavours
that are different to those you’ll notice from a regular brew, but truly
lovely in their own way. Another advantage is that cold brew coffee keeps for
several days in an airtight container, so if you’re looking at a long hot week
you can make a litre on Monday and feel pretty refreshed and pleased with
yourself right up to the weekend.

**Ice Cube  
** The real life rap star Ice Cube did genuinely once say _“I make a mean cup
of coffee, if you give me the right ingredients.”_ But the same is also true
of the kind of ice cube you find in the freezer. A few cubes of ice offer a
speedy and versatile way to make your regular coffee a whole lot more
refreshing.

HOW: When making your coffee, simply use half the water you usually would.
This applies to cafetieres, aeropresses and drip filters. Alternatively you
can use an espresso from your machine. The other half of the water will come
in the form of ice in your glass. Adding milk and sugar is optional depending
on what you’re in the mood for.

HOW LONG: Around 3 minutes.

RESULTS: This method can be pretty variable in terms of the flavours it
produces, so if you’re keen on a consistent cup then maybe keep reading.
However, it’s super quick and super refreshing.

**What to brew?** **  
** Just as rappers and hip hop artists will put together a set list to please
their audience, you need to [choose a coffee](https://pactcoffee.com/coffees)
to suit your taste (we’re really committed to this metaphor). If you like your
chilled coffee sweet and creamy then the nutty chocolatey notes of our
Planalto should work really well for you.

Conversely, if you prefer to leave milk out of the equation and fancy
something purer, then we’d recommend a fruity, juicy coffee like the Finca
Buenos Aires that’s on our [Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/finca-buenos-aires) at the moment.
Alternatively, the Limited Edition coffee that’s currently on the menu, La
Secreta, boasts hints of peach and makes a lip-smacking cold brew.
