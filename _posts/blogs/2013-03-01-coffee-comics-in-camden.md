title: Coffee & Comics in Camden!
---

We get a lot of emails along the lines of:

_“You chaps sure do sound smashing, but I’m not sure I want to buy your coffee
just yet because I can’t be sure it’s as good as you say. Isn’t there a chance
that all the people saying nice things on Twitter are really an evil
mechanical army?”_

_Sincerely,_

_Wing-Commander Norbert Wafer._

So tomorrow we’re putting our money where our mouth is, and **would love your
help to spread the word.** From 10am tomorrow morning, we’re taking our filter
machine and coffee grinder up to the good people of [Mega City Comics in
Camden](http://www.qype.co.uk/place/491592-Mega-City-Comics-London) and who
are kindly letting us set up shop outside theirs! It’s great to be working
along side such a fabulous local business.

We’ll be brewing a batch of **incredible Brazilian beans that are roasting as
we speak**. It’s a ‘pay as you please’ affair and everyone gets a sample bag
of fresh coffee too so we’re should be drowning in a sea of happy faces.

Please come along and say hello; we’d love to buy you a coffee. Also, if you
think this is the kind of thing your friends may like, help us spread the word
by popping a link on Facebook, Twitter or give them a good-old-fashioned phone
call. If they live nearby you could even knock on the door. Door knockers
don’t get as much love as they used to.

Hope to see you there,

Ann, Stephen & Joe x
