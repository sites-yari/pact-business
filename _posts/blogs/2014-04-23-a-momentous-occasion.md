![100,000](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/100000.jpg?w=545)

Release the white doves and let the ceremonial trumpets sound as we fire a 12
gun salute, for Pact has delivered its 100,000th bag of coffee!

[James Whatley](https://twitter.com/@whatleydude), who joined Pact in November
last year and is onto his 11th bag, was the lucky recipient. It feels like
just yesterday that we were shipping his first ever bag of wholebean Finca San
Antonio.

Since Prince George is still touring Australia, we sent some Pact dignitaries
to James’ office to share in the glory of the 100,000th bag. Pact founder
[Stephen](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/02/19/introducing-stephen-rapoport-
founder/ "Introducing… Stephen Rapoport, Founder"), along with our coffee guru
[Pete](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/07/11/introducing-pete-customer-
service-community/ "Introducing… Pete, Customer Service & Community"), raised
a cup of [India Bibi ](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/india-bibi)to toast
James and his lucky bag of beans.

Congratulations from the team at Pact, James. And here’s to many more!
