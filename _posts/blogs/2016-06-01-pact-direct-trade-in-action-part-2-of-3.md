## Phase 2: Upgrading their kit.

**Transcribed from a chat with Will, our Head of Coffee.**

At the end of Phase 1 we have delicious coffee, we’ve started to build a great
relationship with the producer and their Coffee Quality Score has had a bump.
At this point, we say to the producer, “Okay, you’ve made these improvements
for us, so what’s the best way for us to make a small investment to repay that
effort?” Phase 2 is where we look at the best ways to help the farm, to
demonstrate our commitment to them.

These investments can be anything from $10 to a couple of hundred dollars. Our
motivation is to help improve their Quality Score even further, and to
streamline what they’re doing on the farm to make these quality improvements
over a larger volume of coffee.

One of the Colombian producers we worked with, Finca El Cairo, used the money
they earned by selling their initial specialty crop to us, to expand their
drying area. This increased the quantity of speciality coffee they could
produce by a factor of six. To give you an idea of what that means, they
jumped from producing 10 sacks of specialty coffee per year (for us), to 60
sacks of specialty coffee the next. The financial impact of that for them was
huge.

In Phase 2 we provide farms with thermometers and humidity meters. These small
gadgets enable them to track data about the farm more easily. Without them,
producers rely on outdated methods for measuring conditions on the farm, that
lack precision and consistency and result in poorer quality coffee. These
projects for me are just fantastic because they are the foundation of us
making coffee a force for good.
