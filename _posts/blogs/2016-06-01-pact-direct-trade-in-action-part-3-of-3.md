## …then Phase 3: Helping them grow.

**Transcribed from a chat with Will, our Head of Coffee.**

This phase is all about looking at how we can finance farmers to scale up more
rapidly, so they can sell more quality coffee, faster. At this point we
already have a strong relationship with the producer. We know they are
committed to producing great quality coffee and as business people they want
to produce specialty coffee at scale. To help them to do that we often
introduce them to local agronomists, who work with them to understand the soil
in minute detail.

**Investment in action…**  
When working with Finca El Cairo, we realised that increasing the size of
their washing station and their drying patio would offer a massive improvement
to the farm. Rather than wait for them to sell us enough coffee to finance
these improvements themselves, we offered to fund the project through a loan,
which will be paid back over a year, interest free. We’ve helped to put them
in a position where they’re producing 150 sacks of specialty coffee annually,
with coffee buyers (not just us) willing to pay great prices for it. This
increased revenue has allowed them to renovate the entire farm; they are able
to continually grow amazing coffee; they are able to pay their workers a good
wage; and they are able to have a good life.

**Speciality coffee needs a skilled workforce.**  
One of the things about specialty coffee versus commodity coffee, is it takes
a lot more skill to produce. Skilled workers demand a higher wage and good
working conditions. If you pay your workers badly they don’t pick the cherries
with care, they cut corners while working in the mills, they don’t set up the
processing equipment properly, they don’t turn the cherries on the patios
enough, so you end up with defects in your beans and will ultimately end up
with commodity grade beans, being sold at commodity price.

To produce specialty coffee it’s more than just good growing methods. It
requires skill and care every step of the way, which means you have to make
sure there are skilled workers all the way through. You simply can’t expect to
benefit from that skill without paying a proper wage.

**Creating mutually beneficial relationships.**  
At no point in our working relationship is a producer forced to sell their
coffee to us. We don’t work with them to get a monopoly on their coffee. But
usually when we start these relationships they want to sell all their crop to
us. That, to me, is a strong indicator of how important their relationship is
with us and how much they want to keep it going.

These producers are not indentured to us. We contract their coffee, which
creates an incentive and a sense of security, and it’s a two way street. We
sit down with them and create a mutually beneficial relationship, the farmers
have a lot of agency as business people. They have a fantastic product that we
love and we want to make sure they are rewarded properly. When we find those
producers we want to do everything we can to keep that product available.

## **Why do so much more than supermarkets and commodity coffee companies?**

One of the key ties Pact has that I think lots of people who sell commodity or
even other specialty companies don’t, is the link that Pact creates between
the coffee producer and the person enjoying the coffee at the end of the
chain:

Most coffee producers are never credited for the effort they put into
producing. Their coffee has been mixed at origin or it has landed in the
importing country and the roaster has slapped their name across it and
labelled it as their brand’s Colombian or Brazilian coffee. I think it’s
important to be able to trace your coffee all the way back, just as you would
with milk or beef, not just to the country or region but to its exact farm and
producer. Traceability is essential for quality and ethics.

arrives at HQ direct from the farmer Sitio Fernandes in Brazil’s Carmo de
Minas region.

That’s why with every Pact coffee you receive your coffee card and it credits
the person that has spent all year growing that coffee. The person who has
found a specific patch of land they thought was special and chosen the
specific intricacies of growing and processing the coffee. All these things a
producer chooses to do impacts the flavour profile of the coffee and makes it
unique.

I know I sound like a crazy person when I say, “this coffee tastes like mango
smoothie” but when you taste all these coffees lined up next to each other you
can taste all these intricate little differences and that’s the whole reason
for liking and disliking coffee.
