There’s nothing better than a coffee, right? Well, unless it’s St Patrick’s
Day of course, and then there’s nothing better than an Irish coffee!

While Saint Patrick’s Day typically celebrates the patron saint of Ireland,
it’s also considered a little time out from any lent-imposed food and alcohol
restrictions. Now, we’re not recommending you go back to drinking instant,
we’re simply encouraging you to embrace your inner-Irishman!

So, whether you’re actually Irish or just enjoy adding whiskey to your coffee,
it’s time to dust off that emerald-green pullover, pin a shamrock to your coat
and raise a glass to Ireland with this classic recipe!
