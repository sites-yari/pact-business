Yes, we do! We understand that sometimes on occasion you might want a
caffeine-free brew. Whether it’s your tenth cup that day, you fancy a coffee
and it’s a little late in the day, or you’re currently riding the new year
low-caffeine wave – we’ve got your back. Here to save you from mediocre
caffeine-less coffee, we’ve added a brand new decaf coffee to our menu this
year, plus decaf Pact Pods! It’s super easy to change your order to include
decaf, just make sure you select decaffeinated coffee as an option in your
account preferences.

If you haven’t tried one of our decaf coffees before and you’re wondering how
they could possibly be delicious (because trust us, they are!), here’s a
little more behind the science that goes into making coffee beans
decaffeinated…

## The 4 decaffeination processes

The are 4 ways to decaffeinate your coffee beans; direct-solvent process,
indirect-solvent process, the Swiss Water process and the Carbon Dioxide
process. The first two use a chemical solvent to remove the caffeine and
around [70%](http://www.coffeeconfidential.org/health/decaffeination/) of all
coffees are processed using these methods. Direct solvent process is where you
steam the beans to open their pores before flushing them with a solvent to
dissolve the caffeine before washing it away. The second method (indirect-
solvent) differs in that the solvent doesn’t come into contact with the coffee
beans. You first soak the beans in hot water to remove the caffeine (and
flavours and oils as a by-product). The caffeine bean-water is then treated
with the solvent to remove caffeine and the remaining solution is then
reintroduced to the beans to reabsorb the flavours and oils.

The third decaffeination method is the Swiss Water method, which is highly
popular in the States and is similar to the indirect-solvent method. You first
use hot water to remove the caffeine from coffee beans to create flavourful
coffee water but instead of extracting the caffeine using a chemical, you use
filters! [You can read more about the process

#### We use the CO2 method to decaffeinate our coffee.

It’s a very recent method of extracting caffeine from coffee beans; the use of
C02 selectively extracts just the caffeine from the beans. Here’s how: after
the coffee cherries are washed, the green coffee beans are brought into
contact with pressurised, liquid carbon dioxide. The CO2 is circulated through
the coffee, drawing the caffeine out of the bean. An evaporation stage
separates the caffeine from the CO2, leaving the beans with just 0.01%
caffeine. This process is repeated until the beans are decaffeinated. The
coffee is then gently dried until it reaches the original moisture content and
is ready for export and roasting. Although this method is costly, it’s a
chemical-free process, the Carbon Dioxide can be re-used to process multiple
batches of beans and also results in deliciously flavourful decaf coffee.

## But why is it so tough to make good decaf coffee?

  1. Most decaffeination processes can remove or damage many of the compounds that give speciality coffee it’s complex and distinctive flavours. While SWP is environmentally-friendly and suits less acidic coffees, it often leaves the decaffeinated coffee tasting muddy. Similarly, while solvent-based methods retain bright coffee flavours, this process often means you get coffees with less body.
  2. It’s extremely hard to roast decaf beans well. After processing, they can be much harder to control and can often react inconsistently when roasting.
  3. Decaffeination is unfortunately where coffee which isn’t selling ends up, often as a last resort to sell it. But not here at Pact, we arrange all of our own decaffeination, using the same great coffee you love in standard lines so you’ll often see the same great coffee available both caffeinated and decaffeinated.

Did you know… adding decaf to our menu was all thanks to you, our lovely
customers! [Read here to learn more about Pact People Power (that’s you!)
