---

Today has been a big day at Pact HQ, especially for Christiaan.

It fell to him to judge our three entries into The Big Pact Bake Off, which
were lovingly prepared by Anneliese (Design), Richard (Head of Growth) and
Gabi (Head of Coffee). They were all beautiful interpretations of the
[**Mochaccino Cupcake**](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/19/the-big-
wednesday-pact-bake-off/ "The Big Pact Bake Off") recipe we posted
[here](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/19/the-big-wednesday-pact-bake-off/
"The Big Pact Bake Off") and were presented with panache and individuality.

In terms of looks you can vote for your favourite below, and to see what they
tasted like have a gander at the video we took of our rigorous taste test.*
