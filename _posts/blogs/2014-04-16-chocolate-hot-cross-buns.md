title: Chocolate Hot Cross Buns
---

Easter is a special time for a lot of people. Whether you appreciate its holy
nature, love chocolate, or simply enjoy the freedom of back-to-back bank
holidays, there’s something to suit everyone. For me, Easter is about lazy
mornings, double doses of coffee and some good company – the chocolate goes
without saying.

As I suspect the Easter bunny won’t be visiting my house this year, I’ve taken
matters into my own hands. Given my personal tastes fall somewhere between a
childish love of egg-shaped chocolates and being a real-life adult, who enjoys
sophisticated spiced buns, I’ve dug up a recipe that ticks all boxes.
Chocolate hot cross buns are perfect for easter Sunday breakfast, and any time
in between.

This recipe is a little tougher than I usually do, but the results are
spectacular. And, as always, make sure you have a Pact coffee ready for the
when the oven timer makes it’s heavenly strains!

**Ingredients**

For the buns:  
400g strong white flour  
7g sachet fast-action yeast  
50g caster sugar  
1tsp salt  
2 tsp mixed spice  
1tsp ground cinnamon  
250ml warm milk  
1 medium egg  
50g butter (plus extra for greasing)  
150g chocolate chips (I used a mix of dark and milk)  
50g plain flour

For the glaze:  
2 tbsp caster sugar  
4 tbsp boiling water

**Method  
**  
1\. Put flour, yeast, sugar, chocolate and salt in a mixing bowl and stir.
Make a well in the centre.  
2\. Pour milk, butter and egg into the well and mix using a wooden spoon until
a stretchy mixture is formed.  
3\. Dust a clean surface with flour and knead dough for five to ten minutes
until springy.  
4\. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly greased bowl. Cover with a clean,
damp tea towel and place in a warm place to allow the dough to rise. Leave for
about an hour, or until the mixture has doubled in size.  
5\. While you wait, heat oven to 180 **°** C/gas mark 6.  
6\. Tip onto a lightly dusted surface and divide into even portions – dividing
the mixture into thirds and thirds again will make nine, decent-sized pieces.
Roll the pieces into buns and arrange on a lightly greased tray leaving room
for them to rise further.  
7\. Mix plain flour with one tsp of sugar and 4-5 tbsp water to make a paste.
Spoon the mixture into a piping bag and mark the buns with a cross.  
8\. Place in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes (or until golden brown).  
9\. To prepare the glaze, melt sugar in boiling water.  
10\. Transfer baked buns to a cooling rack and brush the glaze.
