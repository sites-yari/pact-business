title: Introducing Anneliese (and her limited edition Pact tote bags)!
---

Anneliese is one of the newest members of the Pact team and, since she’s a
stylish and vivacious design-type, we thought it was about time we introduced
her.

Anneliese’s main job here is making sure everything we do looks good. But when
we found out that she is a fashion designer, previously working for Burberry,
we thought we should put her skills to the test. She rose to the challenge
beautifully and has now whipped up some limited edition Pact Coffee Tote Bags…

There are only 100 of these marvellous bags in existence. That means each one
– adorned with hand-drawn illustrations – is a rare work of art.

So who gets to have one? Well, in the interests of fairness we’ve chosen 100
Pact customers at random, who’ll be receiving a bag in the post. So, as well
as having Pact coffee deliveries to look forward to, you could also be
receiving this high-fashion freebie!

We spoil you. We really do.

**A little more about Anneliese…**

**What does your favourite mug look like?** _I like my coffee to stay piping
hot, so my mug of choice has a knitted mug-warmer on it (see picture). Yes, my
coffee is totally on trend._

**What’s the worst fashion faux pas someone can make while drinking coffee?**
_Drinking instant, it’s totally gone out of fashion!  
_

**Who is your coffee-loving style icon?** _Marilyn Monroe, no one can drink
coffee like her, I’ll spend my life trying though…_
