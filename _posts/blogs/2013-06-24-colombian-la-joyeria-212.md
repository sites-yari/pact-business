We went on the hunt for a coffee that filled the ‘bright, lively’ category in
our coffee portfolio, and we’re thrilled with this one. It’s fairly acidic but
really well balanced with a creamy, fruity body. Pop it in a filter, pourover
or aeropress and you’re in for a treat!

We tried numerous different roast profiles before settling on this one. It’s
fairly, which preserves the coffee’s acidity. Any darker and it was a little
too full bodied, which tasted a little imbalanced for Nick’s exacting palate.

This is known as a single picking coffee, which is super-rare. That means that
not only is it single origin (country), single estate (grower) or even just a
single lot (little bit of the grower’s farm), but that the beans were all
picked during the same 48 hour period, from the same spot, when the beans were
at their very best. There are only 12 sacks of this coffee in existence, and
we managed to snag 3 of them!

The farm itself is called Santa Barbara and is [here in
Antioquia](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Antioquia&hnear=Antioquia,+Colombia&gl=uk&t=m&z=7).
It is a model for ethical farming practice (something sorely lacking from most
of the mass market growers). All the staff are paid 30% over the minimum wage,
and half receive free housing – part of the reason that many have worked here,
full time, for a decade. They even assist retiring pickers in purchasing a
smallholding when they retire. Hats off to the Echavarria family, and let’s
hope more growers follow in their humbling footsteps.
