With the Holiday Season rapidly approaching, we wanted to give you a little
heads up of how your Pact Deliveries will be affected.

Due to the disturbance to the Post Service over Christmas, we won’t be
dispatching any packs of coffee between the **20th December and 3rd January**.
This means we can’t supply you with any fresh roasted coffee between these
dates.

**Don’t Panic!**

If you’re an existing Pact customer, and you’re due to have a bag delivered
over the Christmas holidays, we’ll be dispatching it on the 20th December so
you’ll be stocked up in time. After the 2nd, we’ll put you back on your usual
frequency.

If you’re signing up over the break, your first bag will be shipped as soon as
we start dispatching packages again on the 2nd of January.

**Too Much Coffee?**

If you don’t want your shipments changed, just [visit your account
page](http://www.pactcofee.com/account) using this link, and pick the date
you’d like your next bag to arrive.

**Any other questions?**

Just pop us an email at [ahoy@pactcoffee.com](mailto:ahoy@pactcoffee.com), or
you can give us a call on [0207 231 2047](tel:+442072312047).
