title: 'Our latest coffee: The High-Top Vinyl Blend'
---

High on the rooftops of Hoxton in East London, a band of genuine coffee
aficionados have been toiling away and now – after months of hard work – the
fruits of their labour have paid off.

and Eyelet St. Pierre on their rooftop plantation.

Eyelet St. Pierre and Farron Dax (known as FD) are leading an ambitious
scheme; repurposing London’s desolate rooftops to grow and process world-class
coffees. We’re excited to announce that, after uncovering the perfect varietal
whilst on a visit to Brazil, they have succeeded in producing the UK’s first
ever local coffee; The High-Top Vinyl Blend.

“When we started out we were totally povo. But we’ve been lucky to get funding
from some private investors,” Eyelet explained when the pair popped into Pact
HQ last week. “Our lead investor runs a creative space in Hackney – he was
super keen to get involved as soon as we got him clued up. We’re all about
embracing the vitality of the city and what it means to be a human in the UK
today, and capturing that special energy in bean form. I mean that’s never
been done before. It’s cray cray.” Eyelet has a contagious kind of enthusiasm
for coffee that is set off perfectly by FD’s quiet depth and intensity. In
fact FD didn’t really say much during his visit to Pact HQ. He was mostly
doodling in his Moleskine.

“So anyway,” Eyelet continued “word spread and we were approached by fashion
designers, food photographers, fixie bloggers and stuff who wanted to invest.
Our investors are inspirational makers, you know? All FOMO, all YOLO. And who
doesn’t love coffee?”

He’s right. And who wouldn’t love their coffee? In terms of flavour it’s totes
amazeballs. According to FD’s tasting notes it as carries a complex cigar
tobacco ambience, banterish epicentres and fennel citrus notes.

Their critics, however, were less impressed, one going so far as to tweet
“riiiight.”

When asked about where exactly the coffee is grown, a twinkle creeps in FD’s
eyes. “Right up on the roof!” exclaims Eyelet. “A totally sad space that’s
been given a new lease of like, life. One of the most awesome areas of the
plantation is actually above this cat cafe. The cats are allowed to roam
around up there, doing their business etc. (LOL) and it really adds to the
depth of the flavour. Totally organic. And so immensely inspiring.”

We couldn’t help but wonder, if the plantation is spread across a number of
rooftops, isn’t it a bit of a nightmare for growers? “Totally. 100%
nightmare.” Eyelet confirmed “We grow our coffee 24 metres above sea level, so
climbing all those stairs is cream-crackering, we – and the rest of the
growers and pickers – just have to make sure we wear sensible clothes and
shoes and stuff. High-tops are massively imperative for supporting your arches
on the stairs.”  
So there we have it, a coffee grown here in the heart of London by serious
coffee lovers who weren’t afraid to take a risk. We think it’s a risk that’s
paid off, but why not try it for yourself by making The High-Top Vinyl Blend
your next coffee?
