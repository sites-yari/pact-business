This week we discovered a coffee that really puts a spring in your step, hairs
on your chest, a glimmer in your eye and gives you the fuel to get you through
almost anything. It’s called the Red Eye and it’s as tasty as it is
caffeinated.

**A little history for you**

The Red Eye was invented as a friend to the passengers on the long plane trip
between New York and the West Coast of the USA. The red eye flight, which
leaves late and arrives early, makes a good night’s sleep impossible to
achieve, and strong coffee a necessity.

**How to make a Red Eye**

It’s so easy to make. If you follow our simple brew guides for
**[drip](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/26/pour-over-brewing-guide-v60/)**
and **[espresso](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/02/19/espresso-brewing-
guide/) ** and simply combine the two at the end, you’ve got yourself a Red
Eye.

**Will’s advice**

Will recommends using coffees with complementary flavours. This time he chose
our Finca La Montana Espresso for the shot and used the Finca La Joyeria for
the pour over. The **[Finca La Montana
Espresso](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)** tastes like cinder toffee,
while the **[Finca La Joyeria](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)** has
distinct chocolate flavours – together they reveal flavours similar to a
Crunchie bar!
