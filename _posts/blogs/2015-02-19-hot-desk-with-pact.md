title: Hot desk with Pact.
---

There are a lot of great things about working from home. For a start, your
daily commute is equal to zero. No-one bats an eye if you rock up at your desk
in your PJs, and you can indulge in water cooler conversations with any pets
you have. On the other hand, sitting at home by yourself can send you a little
stir-crazy.

If you’ve found yourself building pillow forts instead of focusing on your
rapidly-filling inbox, then maybe you’d like to set up a desk at Pact HQ?
We’re opening our doors to a few super Pact customers who would like to share
our office with us.

We’re offering a workspace, free WiFi, lively conversations about whatever
television series we’re currently hooked on and, of course, all the coffee you
can drink. In return we’re hoping to meet some exciting people who are doing
exciting things. **[A bit like this

Jonny.")**.

A sneak peek at Pact HQ.

**The nitty gritty.  
** There are a couple of finer details to keep in mind when applying to share
our space with us.  
– You’ll be able to work here from 9.30am – 6.30pm Monday to Thursday and
9.30am – 4pm Fridays.  
– This is a bit of a trial, so we’ll be operating on a month-to-month
schedule.  
– We’ll need a couple of references.  
– We’d like to a learn a little bit about you to kick things off.

**Update: Unfortunately, due to a huge response, we’ve had to close
applications for now. If you’re disappointed you missed out, watch this space.
We’ll let you know when you can apply for the next chance to hot desk with
Pact.**
