It’s that time of year when our coffee is running out and we get the chance to
change things up. Our new espresso blend has been carefully designed by Nick
to ensure great tasting all-round espresso using Brazilian and Guatemalan
single-estate beans.

The Brazil bean is from Fazenda Rodomunho, which is located in the Alto
Paranaíba, the highest part of Minas Gerais’ Cerrado region, at some 900-1,050
metres above sea level. It extends over 450 hectares, of which 316 hectares
are planted with some 1.3 million coffee trees of Mundo Novo, Catuaí, Acaiá
and Icatú varietals. This lot was processed using the Brazilian pulped natural
method. After being picked, the ripe cherries are pulped on the same day at
the farm’s wet mill; the beans are then moved immediately to dry on the farm’s
patios without any fermentation or soaking. This means that, unlike a fully
washed coffee, the sticky outer mucilage is still attached to the beans during
drying, typically producing a fruitier cup.

The Guatemalan bean is grown by Aurelio, who has a beautiful farm located in
northwest Guatemala, in La Libertad, Huehuetenango. At an altitude of 1372 –
1737m, it has a total size of 37 hectares; 23 hectares of which are cultivated
with 3 varieties of coffee: Bourbon, Caturra and Pacamara. Two beautiful
mountains around La Esperanza, and another with natural forest in the middle,
receive 1800mm of rainfall annually, making it very humid. The amazing natural
views and forests throughout the farm allow them to combine coffee production
with coffee tours.

Tasting notes: Espresso blend combining our Brazilian and Guatemalan single-
estate beans. Think big chocolate flavors with a sweet hazelnut and berry
kick. Very rich and smooth.
