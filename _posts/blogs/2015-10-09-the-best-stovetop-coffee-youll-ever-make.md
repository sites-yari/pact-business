title: "The Best Stovetop Coffee You\u2019ll Ever Make"
---

The Stovetop Moka Pot is a challenging way to make delicious coffee. Unlike
its close cousin the espresso machine, it brews hotter and at a lower pressure
and speed, which can easily lead to bitterness. We’re not to be deterred
however! Let’s make something beautiful with the stovetop.

First, boil some water in a kettle. We’d always recommend you use filtered
water, so some from a Brita. Don’t worry if you haven’t got any. Leave the
water to cool for about a minute.

In that minute, get your coffee ready. If you’ve got it from us ground, then
great, nothing more to do here. If not, then grind it to medium-fine, similar
to what you might use for an Aeropress.

(There’s some confusion about the similarity between a stovetop and an
espresso machine. It’s important you don’t use a fine grind in a stovetop moka
pot, as you would for an espresso machine. A fine grind works in espresso
machines because of the high speed and pressure of coffee extraction. Because
the stovetop is slower and applies less pressure during the extraction, a fine
grind will lead to a sharp increase in bitterness.)

Pour the water into the lower part of the stovetop moka pot up until the
pressure valve and no higher.

Fill your coffee basket with coffee and then level off the coffee grounds with
your finger. You don’t need to press or pack the coffee down, let gravity do
the work for you!

Carefully drop the coffee basket into the lower part of the moka pot, ensuring
there’s no coffee around the rim. Holding the base with something to protect
your hand from the heat, screw on the top part of moka pot tightly. Place the
pot on the stove onto a medium-high heat.

Lift up the lid so that you can clearly see what’s going on. As a rule of
thumb: it should take about a minute for the coffee to appear. Any longer than
that you’re on too low a heat. A few seconds after the first bubbles appear
and you hear the characteristic percolating sound, turn off the heat or remove
the pot from the stove and wait until the coffee stops bubbling from the
spout.

There are many kinds of moka pots, in all shapes and sizes, made of different
materials and of varied quality. That’s not to mention the varying intensity
of hobs. If you find that you’re getting too little coffee, leave the moka pot
on the heat for a little longer. Experiment with timing until you get it right
for you. Having done tests here at HQ, we’ve found that even if you get half
the amount of coffee you expected, that half will be twice as strong as the
whole, and taste roughly similar. The moka pot is a wondrous thing.

You’re done! Pour the delicious liquid into two tiny cups and enjoy.
