Yes, it’s that time of year again where we start to make our New Year’s
resolutions. Love ’em or hate ’em, you’ve probably thought about them at
least! But before you settle on your goals for the coming months (although we
might already be too late), why not take a peek at ours…

### 1\. Be healthier

This isn’t about exercising every day… let’s be honest with ourselves! We all
know we took it a little easier over the holidays (except you nutters who ran
on Christmas day), so why not make this about promising ourselves that we
**will** go to that gym/yoga/running class come January and we **will** find
it a little harder than we would have pre-Christmas, but that’s ok. It’s also
about acknowledging that we should probably take it easy with the chocolate
variety packs, just because they’re on sale it doesn’t mean we need to eat
them all. Maybe just a few. So what we’re trying to say is… cutting back is
probably what you need to do this Jan, but it also doesn’t mean deprive
yourself!

### 2\. Save money

The same goes for those pennies. Your bank balance is probably feeling hurt
after all those presents you’ve bought (ever so generous, you) so why not get
creative on how you can skim a few quid here and there. Try cycling to work
once a week and save on petrol? Why not halve the number of takeaways you have
in January? Or instead of buying those half-fat caramel soy mochas to go just
make yourself a lovely brew in the office and take a quick stroll around the
park instead? Easy peasy.

### 3\. Drink great coffee

Have you sensed a theme with our resolutions? You don’t have to be any meaner
to yourself this New Year, so why not make one of your resolutions about
treating yourself better? No one wants to get to the end of the year and
regret not drinking **really great coffee** (we’re serious). Bin the instant.
Ditch those old beans. And make a pact with yourself that you’re only going to
drink delicious beans that make you go _mmmm_. And if you must think about
cutting down on caffeine this Jan, we’re added a couple decafs to our menu and
brand new decaf pods. Because we want to make this January as easy as possible
for you.
