Ahoy!

I’ve spent a few days trying to write our Big Shiny First Post. I’ve played
with ways to explain what [YourGrind](http://www.yourgrind.com) is all about;
what we think is wrong with supermarket coffee and how we’re going to fix it.
But it’s tricky to get across with words alone.

So instead, why not let us buy you a coffee and you can see for yourself?
We’re hosting a Friday pick-me-up this Friday, at [18 Hewett
St](http://www.18hewettstreet.co.uk/).

**Where** : 18 Hewett St, EC2A 3NN

**When** : 1:30pm

**Why?** : Because a great coffee makes Friday afternoon better

You’ll even get a chance to try our latest batch: an incredible single-origin
coffee from Guatemala which we’ll be shipping from tomorrow until it runs out.

They’ve set aside an area for us. Feel free to bring a friend, but please let
us know your names so that we can get you on the list. Just email:
