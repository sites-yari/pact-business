A nice cup of coffee always goes down well, but you just can’t beat having
something with it. Here at Pact, the preference is most certainly a piece of
cake.

If you are wondering what to choose then we have made it as easy as the
aforementioned piece of cake.

This time I’ve chosen to pair our delicious Guatemalan Finca La Joyeria with a
cake recipe. For me this coffee is all about it’s all about stone fruits, so I
wanted to find something sweet and creamy to compliment it.

And my word, what a recipe I have found! Not only is it gluten free, it has
homemade custard on it (!!!), YUM. It is ‘easy peasy’ as the recipe states and
I guarantee you are going to want more after your first slice.

## **Ingredients**

**For the cake base:**

2 tbsp desiccated coconut

5 large egg whites

250g caster sugar

200g pack ground almonds

For the custard topping:

5 large egg yolks

100g caster sugar

150ml double cream

100g butter

2tsp vanilla extract

Toasted flaked almonds, for decoration

**You will also need:**

23cm (9in) spring-form cake tin, well buttered on the base and sides

## **Method:**

Set your oven to 200°C/392°F/Gas Mark 6

Grease a 23cm (9 Inch) spring form pan or loose bottom pan and sprinkle the
coconut in the tin, so it sticks to the butter. _I did this both on the bottom
and sides, and used quite a generous amount so it was nice and covered. Who
doesn’t love a bit of coconut!_

Whisk the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add the sugar while you keep
whisking. Fold in the ground almonds. Spoon the mixture into the tin and bake
for 20-25 minutes, or until just set and a toothpick comes out clean. Keep an
eye on it for the top browning, you don’t want it burnt! Take out of the oven
and leave to cool in the tin, on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Then
take out of the tin.

For the custard: Put the egg yolks, sugar and cream in a pan over a low heat
and whisk constantly until the mixture turns into a thick custard. Take the
pan off the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla extract. Pour into a
bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool then put in the fridge to set.

Place flaked almonds onto a baking tray and put in the oven for 10 mins or
until the almonds are golden.

Once the custard is set stir the mixture and spread evenly across the cake.
Scatter with flaked almonds and sprinkle with icing sugar if you wish. Serve
up with a hot cup of Finca La Joyeria and dig in!

George’s baking and bonus baking tips: ZERO, it’s that easy.
