title: Deliveries over the Easter bank holiday
---

Cometh the hour, cometh the rabbit.

We are of course referring to the Easter bunny, who is currently revving up
for his massive annual chocolate delivery. See pic. But as the rabbit revs up
(almost) everyone else winds down to enjoy the bank holiday weekend. To that
end…

**We’ll not be shipping any coffee on  
****Friday 18th and Monday 21st April.**

If that’s going to leave you short over the holidays, then now is the time to
hit the ‘ship now’ button on **[your Pact Account
Page](https://www.pactcoffee.com/account) >**

Easter, feel free to email our Customer Champions,
