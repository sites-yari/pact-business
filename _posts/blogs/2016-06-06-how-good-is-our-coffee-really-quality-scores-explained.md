******We pride ourselves on selling specialty coffee. That word ‘specialty’ is
important to us. It means our coffee has been awarded with a Quality Score of
80 or above. But where does that Quality Score come from, and what does it
tell you about what’s in your cup?**

As long-standing Pact customers will know, every coffee has its own unique
personality. They’re tricky to compare, so the SCAA (Specialty Coffee
Association of America) came up with a system to give every coffee a score out
of 100.

**Coffee Quality Scores broken down:**

**65 – 80 = Commodity Coffee  
** The type used to make supermarket coffee, blends and instant.

**80+ = Specialty Coffee  
** The flavours are more subtle, the cup more balanced. At Pact we only buy
coffees of 84+, though most of them score 86+.

**90+ = Presidential Award  
** These prestigious coffees make up less than 1% of the specialty coffee
market, they’re just that rare. And that good.

**What’s a coffee’s Quality Score based on?  
** Following a series of ‘cuppings’ from coffee tasting pros, a score is
awarded based on a number of different criteria:

**Lack of defects  
** A coffee with any defects ([you can find out about those
here](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/06/01/brendan-the-fastest-bean-sorter-
in-bermondsey/)) is unlikely to score more than 80 points,  
as the penalty is so high. Between 1 and 3 points can be dropped if a defect
is detected in the cup,  
and multiplied by the number of cups in which it’s present.

**Sweetness  
** There are lots of different types of sweetness in coffee; fruit, honey and
sugar are three examples.  
The more distinct and pleasant, the higher the score.

**Acidity  
** Acidity can be malic (apple), tartaric (grapes) or citric, for a high score
the acidity won’t be overwhelming.

**Balance  
** We all know coffee is bitter but the bitterness can often be pleasant.  
The best coffees have a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness.

**Mouthfeel  
** Coffees all have a slightly different viscosity. Think of the difference
between the feel of butter,  
juice and tea in your mouth, if consistent, they all have their own merits.

**Flavour  
** All of the above happen in your mouth, but when you taste anything there’s
also usually a lot going on behind your nose.  
A high Quality Score will reflect well-developed flavours, which might include  
peach, chocolate, cherry, blackcurrant and even Earl Grey tea.

**Quality Scoring in action…**

Will, our Head of Coffee (looking brooding above), has scored thousands of
coffees throughout his career and more than 1,000 coffees for Pact this year
alone. Out of those 1,000 coffees, only a relatively small number will make
the grade and be added to the [Pact Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees).

The highest scoring cup Will has ever tasted was an entrant in Guatemala’s Cup
of Excellence competition in 2014. It was called El Injerto and it scored 96.
To get an idea of how exclusive that stuff was, think of it as the equivalent
of the best bottle of wine produced in France that year.

Will’s second-highest scoring cup ever was from a farm called Finca la Huerta
in Copan, Honduras. It’s a [katimor
](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/18/whats-the-difference-between-arabica-
and-robusta/)variety of arabica bean and he was so taken with he he bought a
batch of it for Pact. It’s on its way to us as I write, and it scored a
stonking 93 out of 100, so keep your eyes peeled for Finca la Huerta on the
[Pact Coffee Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) over the next few
months.
