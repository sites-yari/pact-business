Did you know that food and drink have their own awards season? Earlier this
year, Pact donned its evening dress and hit the red carpet to take part in the
Guild of Fine Foods’ Great Taste Awards. Taking place over 60 days (that’s a
lot of costume changes…), these awards have been called the ‘Oscars’ of the
food world – and it’s literally a star-studded event.

The [“largest and most trusted accreditation scheme for fine food and
drink”](https://greattasteawards.co.uk/files/2018/07/GT-18-What-is-GT.pdf),
the Great Taste Awards involves getting 500 judges and 65 food writers
together in a variety of locations to meticulously blind-test over 12,000
different products. And of those 12,000 products, a select number will receive
a one, two or three-star rating – just 37% of products received accreditation
this year! And that included two of our very own coffees!

The ever-popular [Planalto](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/planalto) and
the incredible [Nyarusiza Ngara](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/ngara-
nyarusiza) both received a Great Taste Awards star (that means they’ve been
deemed “simply delicious”)!

It’s not hard to see why. The Planalto is a super thick, super creamy cup
filled with milk chocolate and malt flavours – hugely popular with Pact
customers, so it’s clear you all have good taste! But for something a little
different, the Nyarusiza Ngara is also a fantastically good coffee. Flavour
notes of honey and blackcurrant, with a coating mouthfeel, it’s definitely
deserving of that star!

We’re not the type to blow our own trumpet… but really, this is Sergio
Mantonvanni’s and Mukashyaka Epiphanie’s success.

The Planalto farm is one the larger ones we work with, but Sergio hasn’t
become complacent. He’s really proved his commitment to quality in the past
year, taking farm manager Acacio to attend a honey processing workshop – just
one of the ways that Planalto keeps getting better.

As for Epiphanie – you can read about her massive impact on the coffee world
[here](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/04/epiphanie-bufcoffee/). She’s a
pretty impressive woman. Taking on the supply chain single-handedly, she
survived a genocide to become the first woman to own a washing station. Now
the owner of Bufcoffee and winner of a Africa’s Most Influential Women in
Business and Government award, she’s clearly going from strength to strength!

Congratulations Sergio and Epiphanie, and a big thanks to the Great Taste
Awards!
