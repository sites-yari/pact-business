Thanks to everyone who attended Pact’s breakfast club on Thursday morning – we
really enjoyed sharing [our new Espresso
Blend](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) with a bunch of our customers. And
we hope they enjoyed tasting it. Judging by the brilliant tasting notes that
were offered up by our Breakfast Club guinea-pigs, they did.

Will, our Head of Coffee, has actually used these tasting notes – along with
his own – to come up with the description of our new Espresso Blend:

****A Black Forest Gateau Espresso, drenched in cream**. **

**So, where did that come from?**

  * One of the most common observations from those taking part was that the coffee was ‘chocolatey’.
  * Most people also found it ‘creamy and smooth’
  * Then some of the tasters identified more subtle aspects of the coffee, noting that it was ‘nutty’ with hints of ‘something fruity’. This was translated into coffee lingo by Will as ‘a cherry jam sweetness’ and ‘an almond flavour’, which people seemed to agree with.

All these things spelt only one thing for Will, as you read up there. Once
he’d suggested **‘** a Black Forest Gateau Espresso, drenched in cream’, there
were lots of nods and we knew we were on to a good thing.
