It has been busy here at Pact HQ in the run up to Christmas. Pact Coffee HQ is
closing over the holidays so the team can have a rest and there will be no
deliveries now until 5th Jan. To make sure everyone has their coffee in time
for the Christmas break, the Pact Team has been working hard to get all our
coffee deliveries out of the door.

Yesterday we found out we had roasted too much coffee. As we like to keep
things flexible for you, it can be quite hard to predict demand and
occasionally we get it a bit wrong. It is really important to us that we stick
to our freshness guarantee – we ship all our coffee within 7 days of roasting,
when it tastes its very best. So rather than letting this coffee go to waste
we have partnered with the wonderful charity
[Crisis](http://www.crisis.org.uk/) who are opening their doors to an expected
4,000 homeless guests this Christmas.

Their distribution centre is down the road from us in Bermondsey and today we
dropped off half a dozen big bags of fresh roasted coffee. It will be used as
part of their [Crisis at
Christmas](http://www.crisis.org.uk/news.php/933/crisis-at-christmas-doors-
open) campaign with centres in London open for nine days from 22 – 30 December
welcoming homeless guests in from the cold for food, warmth and support.

We are so happy that our coffee has found a home and that we are able to
support their wonderful work. Merry Christmas everyone.
