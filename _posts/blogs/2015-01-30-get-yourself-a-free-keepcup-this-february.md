title: Get yourself a free KeepCup this February
---

A few weeks ago, we offered you the chance to earn yourself a free Clever
Dripper if you invited three friends to Pact. We have had remarkable response
to this offer and our stock has ran out! It turns out that we had ordered the
last batch to enter the UK until April.

So, we will be updating our offer for the rest of the month to the
[KeepCup](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/08/28/free-keepcup-when-you-
introduce-3-friends/ "Free KeepCup when you introduce 3 friends"). These were
very popular the first time round and so we want to be able to offer you the
chance to get them again. As usual, credits roll over, so keep on inviting if
you haven’t earned your gift yet.

If you want to read more on how great KeepCups are, [then check out our post
on them](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/08/28/free-keepcup-when-you-
introduce-3-friends/ "Free KeepCup when you introduce 3 friends") – or find
out for yourself by inviting three friends to join us this month.

**How to get a KeepCup For free…**

**This month, we’ll be giving KeepCups  
****away if you can get three friends to sign up to Pact.**

To make things even easier, we’ve set up a simple and speedy way to get your
buddies, pals and amigos on board:

  1. [Log in to your **Pact Account Page**](https://www.pactcoffee.com/login?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=account&utm_content=viralgrinder)
  2. Share your personal invitation code.

And don’t worry, we’ll help you keep track of how many people you’ve signed up
along the way. So all you need to do is get sharing.
