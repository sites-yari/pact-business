**What’s your name and Role at Pact?**

My name’s Richard, and I find new customers for Pact.[

**How long have you been with Pact?**

I joined Pact at the end of June, so 4 months.

**What’s your favourite brew method?**

I’m a recent convert to the wonders of the V60, a brilliant way to make coffee
and something I’ve been recommending to everyone I meet!

**What’s your favourite time of day to make a coffee, and why?**

During the week, it’s at about 8:30am when I arrive at Pact HQ and all is
quiet. That first cup of the day has a certain magic quality which subsequent
brews can’t quite match. At the weekends when I am brewing at home, it moves
to 9:30am and goes perfectly with my Saturday newspaper, mainly the sports
section.

**Who introduced you to coffee?**

It’s less ‘who introduced me’ and more ‘what introduced me’ – in my case,the
‘what’ was starting an university. Coffee seemed to increase my powers of
concentration, lessen the effects of a hangover and give me a good excuse for
a break.

**On what day does your coffee taste best, and why?**

Saturdays – a great way to start a weekend.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**

Given I started at Pact this year and my coffee intake increased at the same
time, I’ll say the [new Arctic Monkeys
album](https://play.spotify.com/album/5bU1XKYxHhEwukllT20xtk?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open)
as it’s been on repeat on my iPod.

**Who would be your favourite celebrity, dead or alive, to make a coffee
for?**

I’m slightly obsessed with the American comedian Demetri Martin so I’ll make
him some coffee and he can tell me some jokes. Being American, he’ll probably
expect it to be from an ancient filter machine which is the mainstay of many a
US police department, well, at least the ones in The Wire and Starsky and
Hutch. I might have to hide my V60 if he comes round.

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**

I tend to find a beer is the drink of choice, when I need to solve the world’s
problems.

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**

The ability to drink a cup at home and teleport to work, thereby eliminating
the tube journey.
