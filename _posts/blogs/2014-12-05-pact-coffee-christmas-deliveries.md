Now we’re all tucking into our advent calendar chocolates (one day at a time
of course), we thought we’d give you a heads-up on Pact Coffee Christmas
deliveries. There are three big headlines we wanted to share:

**1\. Order by the 22nd  
** Pact Coffee HQ will be closed over the holidays, with our last deliveries
going out on the 23rd. That means, if you’d like to get your coffee in time to
accompany those festive mince pies, your order will need to be placed by 1pm
on the 22nd of December. Please note though, that’s going to be a busy day, so
delivery slots will fill up fast.

**2\. Extra bags**  
We’ll be closed between the 23rd of December and the 5th of January, which
could mean one of your deliveries is bumped back a bit. So, to make sure you
aren’t left stranded over those all-important, family-swamped days you can
order extra bags. Simply go to your [Pact Account
Page](https://www.pactcoffee.com/account?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=christmasdeliveries&utm_campaign=20141201blog), order the
extra bags of coffee you’d like and tell us when when you’d like them
delivered. We’ll sort the rest.

**3\. Change your delivery address  
** As well as adding more bags to your order, you can also change where they
go. So if you’re heading to your mum’s for Christmas, you can upgrade her
instant supermarket coffee. Or if you’re going to be staying with your
brother, you can contribute some really really good coffee to the holiday
feast. It’s all designed to make your Christmas that bit more delicious.

_Psst… Unfortunately, no matter how many letters we write to Santa, we’re not
able to stick to our promise of next day delivery over the Christmas period.
Royal Mail will be extra busy, so even though our elves will be working
overtime, we’re at the mercy of the postman. On behalf of the whole Pact Team,
we’re sorry for any inconvenience._
