_**“Whoever invented the bicycle deserves the thanks of humanity.”**_  
Lord Charles Beresford

Here at Pact we couldn’t agree more with Lord Beresford. Our bicycles are more
than just a couple of wheels that get us from A to B. They’re our trusty
friends who keep us fit, save us a little cash and are pretty good for the
environment too. We even have a special stable at Pact HQ where we stow our
faithful steeds during the working day.

So, being the serious cyclists we are, we’re proud to have pledged our support
for [Cycle to Work Day](https://www.cycletoworkday.org/) on Thursday the 4th
of September.

Cycle to Work Day is a national event, which gives everyone the chance to
stretch their legs, reduce their carbon footprint, and save some money while
they’re at it.

Last year’s event saw 20,000 commuters saddle up and cycle more than a quarter
of a million miles. And this year the organisation hopes to double that, with
a little help from you.

All you need to do is jump on the [Cycle to Work Day site
](https://www.cycletoworkday.org/) and make a pledge to ride your bike to work
this Thursday, the 4th September. There are
[prizes](https://www.cycletoworkday.org/prizes) to be won and a number of
retailers will be offering [free bike health
checks](https://www.cycletoworkday.org/free-bike-health-checks) as well.

So, pledge, saddle up and feel great – we sure will be!
