### Rebuilding with coffee

The story behind the last of our trio of Rwandan coffees is one of triumph
over adversity for Epiphanie Mukashyaka, a widow of the Rwandan genocide and
civil war of 1994. Epiphanie took on her husband’s farm with little knowledge
and built it into something remarkable.

Today, the washing stations she built process coffee cherries from as many as
7000 small farms in the Bufundo region of Rwanda, but back in 2000 the
situation wasn’t so certain.

So here’s how Epiphanie went from catastrophe to sending coffee lovers in the
UK some of the best coffees we’ve ever tasted.

### Where did she start?

Initially, Epiphanie used the small amount she had earned from her own coffee
cherries to buy cherries from other farmers in the region. By bringing them
together, she ensured they got the best price possible. What was a reassuring
start, hit hard times when the commodity coffee market hit an all time low.

For many years, she struggled to maintain her business in the Rwandan market,
before finding hope in [PEARL (Partnership to Enhance Agriculture in Rwanda
through
Linkages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership_for_Enhancing_Agriculture_in_Rwanda_through_Linkages)).
PEARL’s goal was to help Rwanda rebuild after the genocide and civil war.
Their director, Tim Shilling, mentored Epiphanie, showing her ways to improve
the quality of her coffee, which opened her up to the speciality market,
allowing her to earn more for higher quality.

> ‘I came up with the idea to build this,’ she said, ‘and nothing was going to
stop me’ — Epiphanie, 2003.

### And then what happened?

From there, she used that knowledge to train and develop her fellow Rwandan
farmers through her newly formed company, Bufcoffee. She used a loan from the
Rwandan Development Bank to lay the foundations for the building of her own
washing station, Nyarusiza (recognise that name?) to further engage local
farmers and get them the best prices for their best beans.

With the opening of her second washing station, Remera, in 2007, she’s now the
biggest employer in her community and pays higher average wages.

### But how does the coffee taste?

Her coffees have won several prestigious awards, including the Golden Cup in
2007, and Cup of Excellence in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. Our Head of
Coffee, Will, had this to say about Ngara Nyarusiza:

> “I’m a big fan of the complex honey sweetness I get when I taste this
coffee. It’s the same kind of sweetness that I tend to fall in love with
immediately. When you combine that with the blackberry flavours and elegant
acidity and it reminds me strongly of field-ripened fruit.” —Will, Head of
Coffee here at Pact.

### Wrapping up

So, Bufcoffee Ltd. not only produces and exports superb, award-winning coffee,
it also empowers 4,608 women and coffee farmers socially and economically.
Through training and by sharing information on how to increase coffee yield,
they’re able to impact the local community immensely. This year, Bufcoffee is
a building a roastery and a warehouse to expand its market and sell to
domestic and regional markets.

We take great pride in working and trading directly with people like
Epiphanie, and having a direct and tangible link with the people that produce
the coffee. We share the same ideology: pay more for better quality, and treat
people with dignity. We hope you enjoy the coffee all the more for knowing a
bit about who produces it!
