title: Odes to Coffee (written by you)

Valentine’s Day will be rearing its soppy head this Friday, so in anticipation
of the global love-in, we’ve altered our packaging. Take a look…

your Pact Coffee Feedback… (taken by @sholgate13)

The idea is that you can write your own Ode to Coffee – a love poem if you
will (assuming you like what we send you) – to let us know what you think of
your latest Pact delivery.

Here are a few we’ve enjoyed thus far (thanks for getting involved guys):

Roses are red, coffee is ground,  
My latest bag of Pact, was a trial one – only a pound.
