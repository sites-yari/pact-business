Wondering how to prepare an amazing coffee cocktail that is going to make your
summer even cooler? Will has the perfect recipe for you: “Rum and Chill” has a
sweet taste of rum and a rich flavour of ripe cherries and date.

Here’s the (very easy) recipe for you to follow; we’re sure you’re going to
absolutely love it!

_**To pre-prepare your cold brew for your cocktail:** Just fill the Mizudashi
filter with 50g of cafetiere-grind coffee, fill the jug with 600ml of water,
pop it in the fridge for 24 hours and voila! Deliciously chilled, cold brew
coffee. _

For this cocktail, any coffee with flavour notes of dried and fresh fruits
works best. Usually you would add ice to dilute your cold brew but for the
purpose of this recipe we’ll be using full brew strength cold brew. To around
200ml of cold brew add a single shot of dark rum and stir, if you’d normally
add milk to your coffee you can add a dash of single cream or Irish cream at
this point. I like it served in a Martini glass but a white wine glass should
work as well.

Enjoy!
