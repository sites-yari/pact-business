Do you know what happens when you mix the musty smell of paperbacks with the
intoxicating scent of freshly roasted coffee? It sends you to another world.

So measure out your life with coffee spoons this summer and take advantage of
Pact Coffee’s special £1 offer for book lovers. Home-delivered, freshly
roasted coffee might just change the way you relax at home for ever.

##### Tell me more!

Coffee tastes best when it’s freshly roasted. Pact Coffee has found a way to
import coffee directly from speciality farms across the world, roast them to
perfection in their London hideout and deliver the most delicious coffee in
convenient, letterbox-friendly packages to anyone in the UK.

The smell when you open their packages is spellbinding and their scheduling
service means you can stay topped up with the best stuff in your home without
ever having to think about it. You’ll taste the difference and love the
convenience.

##### So how do I take advantage of the offer?

Pact is offering book lovers who have never tried the service before their
first 250g bag of freshly roasted for just £1. That’s around 15 cups worth
which normally costs £6.95, so it’s a great deal and a brilliant way to see
for yourself the difference fresh makes to coffee.

To take advantage, head over to
[www.pactcoffee.com](http://www.pactcoffee.com/?voucher=orion&utm_source=PL&utm_medium=Blog-
Orion&utm_content=bodycopy&utm_campaign=orion&yourcode=orion) and go through
their 5-minute signup process with the voucher code **ORION**. You’ll be asked
how you like your coffee so they can pick the perfect coffee to match your
taste and the way you make coffee at home.

Happy reading!
