![LeAnn
Rimes](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/leann.jpg?w=225)Sorry Ms.
Rimes, but our hearts belong to LeAnn Grinds.

Q: What’s blonde, loves country-pop music and makes sure your Pact coffee is
ground to perfection?

A: Our new grinder: LeAnn Grinds!

Well, she may not be blonde, but the other two things are true.

Do you remember a little while ago, when we asked you to [help us name our new
grinder](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/05/07/help-us-to-name-our-new-
grinder/ "Help us to name our new grinder!")? Well, LeAnn won in a landslide
and we couldn’t be happier.

Thanks for all your help. We couldn’t have done it without you. LeAnn will be
joining Pact’s other [unsung
heroes](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/12/the-unsung-heroes-of-the-pact-
packing-room/ "The unsung heroes of The Pact Packing Room") soon, so keep an
eye out for snaps of the girl herself.

**Note:** When the votes were counted on the 10th of July, LeAnn Grinds was a
stand-out winner. We duly filed the paperwork with the local register office,
ordered headed notepaper and set up LeAnn with her own business cards. Little
did we realise that we’d left the poll open and people were continuing to
vote! Public opinion seems to be against LeAnn now but we have to respect her
as a grinder and stick with the result from the 10th. We hope that doesn’t
come as too much of a disappointment for fans of Sir Ranulph Grinds and
Benedict Grindabatch.
