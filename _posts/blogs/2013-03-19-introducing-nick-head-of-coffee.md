title: Introducing Nick, Head of Coffee!
---

Hi, I’m Nicholas and I’m the Head of Coffee here at Your Grind.

I’ve been in the coffee business for 7 years, and have been roasting coffee
for the past 4. In fact, as Roast Master at one of YourGrind’s key suppliers,
I have personally roasted every bean of coffee we’ve ever shipped!

I was so impressed with Stephen’s vision that I’ve come on board to play a
part in delivering it. This is my first week working with Stephen, Ann & Joe,
and what I’ve seen so far is a passionate, dedicated team who are really
excited about providing everyone with fantastic coffee. It’s a passion I’ve
always shared! I’m thrilled to bring my experience to the growing team and to
help grow this idea.

As cool as my job title is, the reality is even cooler! My goal is to search
the world for great coffee, roast it beautifully, and get it to your cup with
no fuss. There are many gears and cogs that have to run smoothly in order to
get your coffee to you at the right time, and as it happens, I’m a gears and
cogs man! We’ll be developing many new ideas in the near future and feedback
is really important to us. If you love your coffee one week, let us know (and
better still, let me know why). If you don’t like your coffee, the same
applies.

We thrive on feedback, it makes everything better.

You can reach out to me on nick (at) [yourgrind.com](http://yourgrind.com/)
any time and I hope to see you at one of our events soon.

Nick
