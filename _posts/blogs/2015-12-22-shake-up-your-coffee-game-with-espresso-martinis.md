**Maybe we’re biased, but general consensus around Pact HQ is that most
celebrations are infinitely improved with an espresso martini. They’ve got the
caffeine kick you sometimes need to get you in the party mood, and we have to
admit that the various spirits play their part too.**

With the party season upon us, we recommend you use this recipe to kick off
your celebrations. Shakers at the ready!

**Ingredients**

Vodka  
Kahlua (Tia Maria works too)  
A double shot of espresso Pact Coffee (we think a shot of strong coffee in any
brew method is a fine alternative)  
Golden syrup or demerara sugar  
Milk (full fat, ideally)  
Plenty of ice

**Method  
**

  * Fill your cocktail shaker up halfway with ice.
  * Melt a teaspoon of sugar in your shot of coffee (you can adjust how much sugar you add depending on how sweet your tooth is!)
  * Add 50ml vodka, 25ml Kahlua, 25ml milk and the coffee to the ice.
  * Give it a pretty enthusiastic shake for about 30 seconds.
  * Pour! And enjoy immediately.
