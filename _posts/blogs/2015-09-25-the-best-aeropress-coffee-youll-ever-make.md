title: "The Best Aeropress Coffee You\u2019ll Ever Make"
---

The Aeropress doesn’t look like a piece of coffee making kit. In fact, to say
that it’s seen by some as the very best coffee maker in the world could sound
crazy. The man who invented it also invented the Aerobie frisbee, for crying
out loud! But the coffee you can produce with it speaks for itself: rich,
tasty, complex, everything you want from good coffee. Here’s how to use it.

_(We’re going to do the inverted method)_

**Things you’ll need:**  
– Aeropress  
– Aeropress Scoop  
– Aeropress Paddle  
– Aeropress Filter  
– Kettle  
– Timer (set at 1 minute)  
– Delicious Pact Coffee

**Let’s do this!**

Combine the plunger and the tube parts, with the rubber coming up to the (4)
on the tube. Stand the whole thing up with the open end facing up. Put one
Aeropress Scoop of coffee in, or about 16g.

Get your timer ready. Add water that has been off the boil for about a minute
right up to the top of the tube. Use the Aeropress paddle to stir 5 times.
Start your timer for 1 minute and let your coffee extract.

George-23-1024x683.jpg)While you wait, get your filter ready. Put it into the
filter holder and pour some hot water through it, minding your fingers if
you’re holding it.

As you come up to the minute mark, screw on the filter holder with the wet
filter, place your mug upside-down on top of the Aeropress and flip the whole
thing over. The mug should now be on the bottom.

Immediately start pressing down. You should be done in about 30 seconds. Once
you’re all the way down and you’ve heard the hissing, use your thumbs to push
the plunger up bit to create a vacuum. This will stop it dripping and making a
mess.
