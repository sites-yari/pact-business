title: The top 5 things you helped us do in 2014.
---

We’re not usually big on New Year’s resolutions here; they tend to fall apart
after a few days, you know, when it’s too rainy to go for a run or chocolate
is too delicious to not get eaten.

But a New Year’s retrospective is a whole different deal.

Looking back at what you’ve achieved is a great way to kick off a new year and
thanks to our customers, 2014 was a big one for us. As you know we only
launched a couple of years ago, in October 2012, so it’s incredible that we’ve
been able to grow so quickly. The support that we – and **[our
coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=coffeemenu&utm_campaign=20141215blog)** – has received from
our customers has enabled us to improve the service we offer you and the way
we work with our farmers. Let’s break it down:

**1\. You helped us go from ‘snug’ to ‘snazzy’.  
** As the team grew at the start of this year, we found we needed a new home.
So in April Pact HQ moved to new digs. We’re still at The Biscuit Factory in
Bermondsey but we’re now really proud to invite customers in for feedback and
tasting sessions, rather than a bit sheepish:

the magic happens.

the whole thing:

**2\. You motivated us to launch our free coffee magazine, The Perc.  
** There’s always lots we want to share with you, to help you get the most
from your Pact Coffee. So, in September we put together a magazine to do just
that. A new edition comes out each month and all customers get a free copy
with their coffee.

**3\. You enabled us to source our own coffees.  
** Before October we were too small to go out to meet coffee growers directly.
We simply didn’t have enough readies to pay for the airfare. Now we do, plus
we’ve got Will, Pact’s Head of Coffee, to go out there and put his coffee
expertise to really good use.

**4\. You supported us launching our new range of coffee gifts.  
** Christmas is all about sharing, so in December we shared a brand new
gifting section with you on
**[PactCoffee.com](https://www.pactcoffee.com/gift/?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=gifting&utm_campaign=20141215blog)**. As well as allowing you
to treat someone to a **[Pact Coffee
subscription](https://www.pactcoffee.com/gift/?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=gifting&utm_campaign=20141215blog)** , it also makes it easy
for you to spoil them with a **[Coffee Brew
Kit](https://www.pactcoffee.com/gift/?utm_source=JR&utm_medium=blog-
all&utm_content=gifting&utm_campaign=20141215blog)**. This was something we’d
had a few requests for, so we’re glad it’s gone down so well and hope our gift
bundles helped you to earn some brownie points on Christmas morning.

**5\. You’ve empowered us to roast our own coffee.**  
Just as with sourcing our coffees, we used to have to get someone else to
roast them too. Our former roaster was Peter and he was a fantastic fellow to
work with. But now we’ve got lots of loyal customers, we’ve been able to take
the plunge and buy our own roaster and also train up our very own roasting
person. Her name is Aissa and you can **[learn more about her
