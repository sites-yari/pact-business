the seal of approval from a selection of Pact customers. Oh yes, a few of you
popped in for a trial tasting event last week and got a sneaky taster of
what’s on the cards. Read on to find out more about Família Montaño and the
kind of reception it got at Pact HQ:

**About the farmer:**  
Cervando Montaño Rocha has been growing coffee in Bolivia’s green and
mountainous North Yungas region since way back in 1977. His story is a bit of
a sad one – but don’t worry it has a happy ending.

When Cervando was just 5 years old, both his parents died of Yellow Fever, and
he was taken in by a local farming family. He worked for them until he was 20,
when – in return for his hard work – he was gifted a coffee farm 10 hectares
in size. Now, nearly 80 years old, Cervando has taught his 12 children and
grandchildren the craft of coffee cultivation, passing on his knowledge from
generation to generation.

**About the farm:**  
Cervando’s farm is located around 1,460 metres above sea level, about 115km
from the Bolivian capital, La Paz, and 7km away from the town Coroico. This
region has ideal coffee growing conditions; a temperate climate, fertile soil
and high altitude. When fully ripe, Cervando’s coffee cherries are picked by
hand, washed and sun-dried on raised drying screens.

**About the taste:**  
When we had a few of you in to Pact HQ, to try Família Montaño it got a pretty
warm response. Here were a few of the adjectives used to describe it…

smooth rich dynamic sweetness refreshing  
comforting dark chocolate rustic lovely

**More about our Família Montaño Brewing Experiments event:  
** The idea behind the evening was working out which brew method works best
for Família Montaño. Who better to ask than our customers?

We tried out four different brew methods: the cafetière, the stovetop, the v60
and the aeropress – all with the recipes we think work best. Though, as per
usual, we stressed the importance of exploring your own preferred recipes to
create the coffee your palate loves.

In the end the winner was (drumroll…) the aeropress, followed closely by the
cafetière and the stovetop! So our number one recommendation for brewing
Família Montaño is with the aeropress but that’s not to say that you won’t
make a pretty mean coffee using any of the other methods. As ever, in the
marvellous world of coffee it all comes down to personal preference!

A great big thanks to everyone who came along last week, it was great to meet
you all and enjoy some seriously good coffee. Don’t forget to keep your eyes
peeled for more Pact Coffee tasting events coming soon…
