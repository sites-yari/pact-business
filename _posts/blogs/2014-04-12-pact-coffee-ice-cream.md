If you haven’t been keeping abreast of Josie’s [“Introducing…” the staff
posts](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/in-the-office/pact-team-in-the-
office/) on the blog, you might not know that I’m one of those antipodean
caffeine addicts the London coffee scene has been raving about. You know the
ones. We drink flat whites and yabber on – with that twang of ours – about how
Melbourne’s really killing it in the world coffee arena. And yet, we’re living
here.

Want to know why? It’s because the UK’s killing it too! Since I arrived last
year I’ve been constantly impressed with what this city has to offer,
particularly at Pact. The only thing missing for me, really, is summer. Until
now!

To celebrate weather’s subtle hints at sunshine, I’ve decided to bring you a
(slightly premature) super summery recipe! Enter Pact Coffee Ice Cream. This
recipe is so simple and so tasty. But the best thing is, if you’re not ready
to embrace icy treats just yet, it keeps well in the freezer. So you can save
it for a not-so-rainy day!

**Ingredients  
** 300ml double cream  
175g condensed milk  
30ml Pact coffee (have you tried our new [Brazilian, the Fazenda
Lagoa](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/fazenda-lagoa)?)  
1 tsp vanilla essence

**Method**  
1\. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.  
2\. Use an electric whisk to whip your mixture. (You’ll know it’s ready when
the mixture forms stiff peaks)  
3\. Transfer the mixture into an air-tight container or seal with cling film
and freeze overnight.

**PACT TIP:** I’ve adapted this recipe from a number I’ve found online. Most
recommend using espresso, however any brew method will do. If you use [a
different brewing technique,](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/coffee-
academy/brewing/brew-guide-brewing/) you might like to increase the strength
of your brew in order to achieve that rich coffee flavour we know you love.
