The classic combo is made extra sumptuous with mascarpone frosting – a
traditional sponge for cake sales and parties

Ingredients

  * 250g pack softened butter
  * plus extra for the tins
  * 100ml strong black coffee (made with 2 tbsp coffee granules), cooled
  * 280g self-raising flour
  * 250g golden caster sugar
  * ½ tsp baking powder
  * 4 egg
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  * 85g walnut
  * 2 tbsp roughly chopped, the rest finely chopped

### For the filling:

  * 100g icing sugar, sifted, plus a little extra for dusting
  * 150ml double cream
  * 100g mascarpone, at room temperature

Method

  1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter 2 x 20cm round cake tins and line with baking parchment. Set aside 1 tbsp of the coffee for the filling.
  2. Beat the butter, flour, sugar, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and half the remaining coffee in a large bowl with an electric whisk until lump-free. Fold in the finely chopped walnuts, then divide between the tins and roughly spread. Scatter the roughly chopped walnuts over one of the cakes. Bake the cakes for 25-30 mins until golden and risen and a skewer poked in comes out clean. Drizzle the plain cake with the remaining coffee. Cool the cakes in the tins.
  3. Meanwhile, make the filling: beat together the icing sugar, cream and mascarpone, then fold in the reserved 2 tbsp coffee. Spread over the plain cake, then cover with the walnut-topped cake and dust with a little icing sugar.
