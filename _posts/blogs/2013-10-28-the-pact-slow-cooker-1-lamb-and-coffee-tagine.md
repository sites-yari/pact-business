Tagine. Keep on reading for the recipe!

Throw the following into a slow cooker for 3 hours:

– 500g lamb shoulder, neck and breast

– 2 x diced sweet potatoes

– 2 x chopped red onions

– 15ish x dried apricots

– 1 little bag of pinenuts

– 3 x cinnamon sticks

– a fistful of mint and corriander stalks, finely chopped

– 2 x stock pots (if you’re feeling lazy, as I am this morning…)

– 1 x heaped table spoon of [Fazenda
Passeio](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/passeio-natural)

20 minutes before it’s ready, throw in a handful of basmati rice, then when
it’s ready serve it straight out of the cooker. Delicious!
