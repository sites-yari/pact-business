title: Coffee with alcohol (a vice two-for-one)
---

Remember Carol? She’s the one who gave us that wonderful berry, espresso and
gin [cocktail recipe](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/18/carol-rocks-at-
cocktails/ "Carol rocks at cocktails.") a couple of weeks ago. Well she’s sent
us another genius method for combining our love of coffee with alcohol (that’s
a vice two-for-one people)! Her tips for infusing coffee with alcohol are
inspired and, as she puts it:

_“There’s definitely no need to heat your booze – the alcohol replaces heat in
this extraction (yay science.)”_

So, fancy giving the science of infusing a try? If you do, Carol recommends
using the Brazilian spirit cachaca, but she said vodka and rum will do just
fine too.

**Slow and steady method (which most people tend to do):  
** Put 50g of whole coffee beans into 700-750ml of your chosen spirit. Some
people choose to crack the beans slightly between two spoons in order to speed
up the process a little bit. Filter out after 24 hours, though feel free to
remove earlier or later depending on your taste. To do this you can use a
muslin, a cheesecloth or a tea strainer, squeezing out as much of the spirit
as you can.

**Quick and dirty method for Aeropress:  
** Rinse your Aeropress filter and invert just as you would when making a
coffee. Use one scoop of[ Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) and
cover with the spirit until you reach the ‘1’ mark on the side. Stir to fully
saturate the grinds and wait for five minutes (as with the slow method, you
can adjust the time to suit your taste). Screw on the filter cap, invert into
a cup and plunge. Keep pressing even if you hear a hissing sound for maximum
coffee extraction. Feel free to dilute with more uninfused spirit if you
fancy.

****Quick and dirty method for** Pour Over:  
**Pop the coffee and spirit into a glass, jar or mug and stir (work ratios out
based on 50g to 700ml). Rinse a filter while you leave it to infuse for a few
minutes then pour through the filter and enjoy.

****Quick and dirty method for**** **Cafetiere:  
** Do your infusion in the cafetiere itself! According to Carol, you can use
your coarse grind as normal, and work ratios out as for the pourover method.
Stir, leave to infuse for a few minutes, plunge slowly and pour.
