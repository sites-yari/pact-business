Like an old friend Fruit and Nut Espresso has remained stedfast with Pact for
quite some time. Seasons have changed, other coffees have come and gone, but
Fruit and Nut has remained and endured as a well loved favourite.

Therefore this cake pairing is a classic for, well, a classic.

Banana cake was an instantaneous choice for this pairing as its not overly
sweet, simple comforting flavours will perfectly compliment the chocolatey and
nutty notes of the coffee.

And how can you resist when it is some of your five a day! *

*probably not. Does however contain fruit, hoorah! 

So spatulas and cake tins at the ready, you are going to go bananas for this
recipe (terrible pun intended). And don’t forget to brew a cup to go with it!

**Ingredients** :

250g butter, at room temperature

1½ cups sugar

4 eggs

2 tsp vanilla extract

4 very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed (about 2 cups)

2 tsp baking soda

½ cup hot milk

3 cups flour

2 tsp baking powder

**Method** :

Preheat oven to 170°C.

Line a medium (23cm-diameter) cake tin with baking paper.

Beat butter and sugar until creamy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then the
vanilla and mashed bananas.

Dissolve baking soda in hot milk, add to mixture and stir to combine.

Sift in flour and baking powder and fold gently into mixture using a big spoon
and a large scooping action to keep the mixture light. Don’t over mix.

Spoon mixture into your prepared tin. Bake until a skewer inserted in the
centre comes out clean.

(My oven is a bit rubbish, hence the slightly darker top. So keep an eye on
your cake, but baking time is roughly between 45mins-60mins).

Leave to cool then cut yourself a slice and enjoy!
