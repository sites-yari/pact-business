The coffee you get in the post has to jump through many hoops before it passes
our Coffee Team’s quality tests.

You all know about [Will](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/16/introducing-
will/) and his trips out to places like
[Brazil](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/07/28/marcus-his-new-coffee-sorter/)
and Ethiopia to meet and trade directly with the farmers, but less is known
about the work our Coffee Team does here at Pact HQ.

For every coffee you see on our [Coffee
Menu](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees), the Coffee Team will have
scrutinised the coffee at origin then reviewed at least two separate samples
at Pact HQ.

In this video Brendan is going through a sample bag of green coffee sent to us
by an Ethiopian coffee-grower Will met in January. The farm itself can be
found in Limu and had monkeys larking about on it. We absolutely love the
coffee Brendan’s sorting here, and if all goes to plan it’ll be on the menu
later this year.

House-4-300x200.jpg.pagespeed.ic.PehCYDR6BU.jpg)](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/wp-
content/uploads/2016/05/Brendan-Roaster-Roast-Grind-House-4.jpg)What’s Brendan
looking for?

When he sorts through the green coffee beans, there are loads of things
Brendan is looking for. There are two different types of defects:

**Category A** – These major defects include things like rotten beans, insect
damage and soured beans.

**Category B** – Less serious issues like chipped or cracked beans and less
serious variations of Category A defects.

If there is one ‘A’ defect in a batch of green coffee, the coffee isn’t up to
our standard; likewise if there are 5 ‘B’ defects, we would send it back.

Defects can be as subtle as the picture below, where the bean is slightly
under developed.

Or they can be as obvious as the little black holes see on the beans below.

These little black holes are from the [Coffee Borer
Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_borer_beetle), a small critter
that can sometimes enter a coffee bean.

This isn’t nearly as serious as it sounds, as they are completely gone by the
time the coffee gets to the green bean stage. And that’s before it’s been
roasted at temperatures exceeding 180°C.

That said, too many little holes in too many beans is a warning sign that
perhaps the farm’s practices aren’t up to scratch.

Because we cherrypick (pun intended) the farms we work with, the quality of
their beans tends to be very high. So the majority of the sample bags we
receive pass these tests with flying colours. It’s a meticulous task, and very
time intensive, but it ensures that you get the very best coffee. It also
safeguards the link between the price we pay and the quality of the coffee the
farmers provide.

That way, our relationships stay transparent and everyone gets a good deal.
