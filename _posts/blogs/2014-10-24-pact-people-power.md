Do you have a game-changing idea for how to improve Pact? If so, we want to
hear it. That’s why we’ve relaunched **[Pact People
Power](http://pactcoffee.uservoice.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-
feedback?utm_source=newsletteractive&utm_medium=uservoice&utm_content=ppp) **
(otherwise known as our way of adding a dose of democracy to your coffee
drinking experience).

Pact People Power is an open forum that allows you to share your ideas with
the Pact community. If there’s something you want to see us try, then let us
know! There’s no right or wrong suggestion – there may be plenty of people
like you who feel the same way.

To make a suggestion for improving Pact, visit the [Pact People
Power](http://pactcoffee.uservoice.com/forums/223203-pact-customer-feedback)
forum and enter your idea. While you’re there, you can also vote for other
people’s innovations.

So get your thinking caps on and head over to the forum. We don’t want those
lightbulb moments to go to waste now, do we!
