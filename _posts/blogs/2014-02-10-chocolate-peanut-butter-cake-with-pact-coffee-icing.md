Big chocolate-covered love goes out to [Chocolate Covered
Katie](http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2012/10/08/chocolate-peanut-butter-
cake-in-a-mug/) and her healthy dessert blog for the inspiration for today’s
(slightly less healthy) [Baking with
Pact](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/baking-with-pact/) recipe. It’s a
Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake with Pact Coffee icing, which you bake in a mug,
in a microwave.

Mind blown yet?

It will be once you’ve had a taste…

Coffee Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake

**Ingredients**

  * 3 tablespoons of peanut butter
  * 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder
  * 2 tablespoons of sugar
  * 2 tablespoons of plain flour
  * 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder
  * A pinch of salt
  * 2 teaspoons of coconut or vegetable oil
  * 3 tablespoons of milk
  * 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract

**Method**

  1. Grease a microwave-safe ramekin or mug (to prevent your little cake from sticking)
  2. Pop your peanut butter in a little bowl and melt it in the microwave
  3. Add in all the other ingredients and mix really, really well
  4. Transfer the mixture to your ramekin or mug
  5. Cook your cake on medium heat for around a minute and a half

**Pact tip:** All microwaves tend to be different; you may want to cook your
cake for longer. The good news is that this cake is egg-free, so you can tuck
in while it’s still seriously gooey without fear of getting a tummy ache.

**Pact Coffee icing  
** Mix a tablespoon of butter with a tablespoon of icing sugar, a teaspoon of
strong [Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) (we used
[Samambaia](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)) and a pinch of cocoa powder.
Spread your icing over your cake liberally and enjoy.
