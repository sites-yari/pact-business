you’re the type who enjoys travelling to exciting new places via your trusty
coffee cup, then we have a treat in store for you. As soon as we tried the
[Finca Las Flores](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/finca-las-flores), we
knew we had to get it in, even though we knew we could only have it on the
menu for a short time…

**About Finca Las Flores  
** This special coffee has come all the way from a little Honduran farm, whose
beans rarely reach these shores. It has been lovingly grown by Roger Antonio
Domínguez Márquez and his family and is distinguished for it’s clean, well-
balanced taste, which ensures it works really well across all brew methods.
During a Pact tasting event last week its bright citrus acidity made it a
really popular choice with the customers who attended, while its subtle
flavours of dark chocolate also stood out.

**Why is this a limited import coffee?  
** These guys harvest only once a year, which means Finca Las Flores beans are
only available from mid-January to the end of March. We jumped in there in
this small harvesting window and gathered up as much as we could. However,
we’ve only been able to get hold of nine sacks of this marvellous stuff. So if
you’d like to try it, you can request that we send you Finca Las Flores as
your next coffee, which will cost £8.95 rather than our usual £6.95.
