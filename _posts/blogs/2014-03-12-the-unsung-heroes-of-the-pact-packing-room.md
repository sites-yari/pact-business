title: The unsung heroes of The Pact Packing Room
---

If you’ve seen [this post](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/10/find-out-
whos-been-packing-your-coffee/ "Find out who’s been packing your coffee…")
you’ll know all about Sheilder, G-Unit, Thrillsy, The Maori Mounty and M-Dog.
But how about the unsung heroes of The Pact Packing Room?

**Heat Ledger and Ce-sealia  
** These are our heat-sealers and they work jolly hard to ensure your bagged
coffee stays fresh once it’s gone out the door. In more formal circles they’re
known as DD400 Pack Sealers.

**R. Kelly  
** This bad boy grinder is a VTA GS Mahlkonig and hails from Germany. He
boasts so much macho power that he makes Mr T look like a little sissy. As
you’ve probably experienced, he manages to combine a certain delicacy with
that power, which ensures the coffee he grinds is the perfect texture for your
preferred brew method.

**Betty**  
Betty is a faithful and longstanding Pact employee and one of The Pact Palace
old guard. Created by the American company Ditting, this ‘Swiss’ model
exhibits a certain regal splendour. She also boasts an attractive copper toned
finish to make even the TOWIE girls envious. The coffee Betty grinds is in for
a treat, she’s gentle but persuasive in creating a dream texture for all grind
sizes.

**Weigh-n Campbell**[  
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEEKGUq-9Y)Like [Wayne
Campbell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEEKGUq-9Y) but more metallic. This
bespoke Posiweigh weighing machine was born and bred in Malvern,
Worcestershire. He is as down-to-earth as he is reliable, so when The Pact
Palace is overwhelmed with orders he really steps up to the plate and takes
care of business.
