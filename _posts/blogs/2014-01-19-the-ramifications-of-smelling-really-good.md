title: The ramifications of smelling really good.
---

As anyone who works on the 2nd Floor of The Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey will
attest, Pact HQ smells pretty blooming good. So good in fact, that when
**[Cycle Training UK](http://www.cycletraining.co.uk/)** held a training
session in the room next to us, they felt compelled to knock on our door.

What they wanted was a little more information about what we do and how they
could sign up to get that delicious fresh coffee smell delivered to their
homes. What they got was some freshly roasted, freshly ground, freshly brewed
coffee to enjoy during their workshop.

It seemed like the right thing to do.

Just goes to show, when your place smells of really, really good coffee all
sorts of nice people will come a-knocking!
