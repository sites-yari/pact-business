title: How to brew a refreshing summer sipper
---

As summer approaches, there are many things to get excited about: longer days,
picnics in the park, wearing fewer clothes. However, after the long winter, it
might take our frozen bodies a little longer to adjust to balmier weather.
While piping hot cups of coffee were our lifeline throughout the winter
period, sipping a steaming brew in the sunshine can lead to a very sweaty
situation.

Cold brew is a great alternative to traditionally brewed coffee, because it’s
not only surprisingly simple to make, but incredibly satisfying on a hot day.
To avoid any sticky predicaments this summer, we asked Brendan, who looks
after quality control in our coffee team, if he has any delicious cold brew
recipes he could share. For those who aren’t sure who Brendan is, he’s this
guy:

… and boy, does he make a refreshing summer cuppa! It would be selfish to keep
this little gem to ourselves, so here’s a simple recipe we like to call ‘brew
_a la_ Brendan’.

**You’ll need:**  
100g of coarse ground coffee (we recommend
[Planalto](https://pactcoffee.com/coffees/planalto))

cafetiere into the fridge and leave for 16-24 hours, depending on how strong
you like your coffee  
**6.** Take the cafetiere out of the fridge, plunge the brewed coffee and
enjoy!

Knowing the UK, you’ll be back to drinking your usual hot cup of coffee in no
time. So enjoy a deliciously chilled one while you can!

_*Don’t worry if you don’t have a_ cafetiere _handy, you can always substitute
it with a Hario V60 and paper filters. Or, if all else fails, a sealable
container and a brand new washcloth will do the trick_!
