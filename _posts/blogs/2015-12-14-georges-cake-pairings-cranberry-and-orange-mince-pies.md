Yes, it is that wonderful time of year again when awful jumpers, terrible
songs and over-indulgence become commonplace.

So in the true spirit of, well – Christmas, we have a mince pie recipe that is
going to make you feel as Christmassy as a turkey dancing to ‘All I Want for
Christmas’ in a santa hat.

This recipe has cranberries and orange in it to give it that extra festive
touch and will be the perfect accompaniment to your cup of coffee.

So put on the oven, assemble your ingredients and get baking! And if you do
give this recipe a go, please tweet/instagram/facebook a photo, we would love
to see them!

Wishing you a very Merry Christmas! George x

P.S. just a reminder that the last chance to order coffee from us is the 23rd,
so get in your Christmas orders when you can!

**For the pastry:**

400g plain flour

50g of ground almonds

330g butter, cold and diced

150g icing sugar

The zest of juice of 1 orange

1 egg

A 12 tin pie tray, not too deep

A pastry cutter

A 12 hole non stick pie tray

_Well, I didn’t have one, so used my 1 cup, cup measure, which is about 8cm in
diameter._

_So you would want a cutter of a similar size._

**For the filling:**

300g mincemeat

100g fresh cranberries

50g sugar

2 tbsp of water

Heat your oven to 180c.

Put the butter, icing sugar, flour and almonds is a large bowl and mix
together with your hands until it is like breadcrumbs. Get your hands in!

Add the orange zest.

Then add in the orange juice until it becomes a dough.

Tip dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and
refrigerate for about 30 minutes.

While the dough is chilling, wash the cranberries then put in a small sauce
pan with the sugar and water. Gently simmer for about 15 mins, then remove
from heat. Add in the mince meat and stir well!

Once the dough is cooled unwrap and place on a floured surface. Grab your
rolling pin and roll it out so that it is about the thickness of a pound coin.

Stamp out 24 circles and place and gently press half of them into your pie
tray. Spoon about a heaped teaspoon of the mincemeat on top. (NB Feel free to
experiment with different pastry cutter/tin sizes, as depending on what size
of mince pie you want or whether you want them deep fill or not, you will need
to adjust the size of pastry cutter and tin accordingly).

Whisk your egg then brush the edges of the pastry shell with the egg. Place
the remaining 12 circles on top of your mincemeat. Gently press the edges
together.

Use the remaining egg mixture to brush the top of the mince pies.

Cook for about 20mins or until golden on top.

Sprinkle with icing sugar.

These are best served still warm, with a cup of coffee and a good dollop of
brandy butter/cream/ice cream, but are still perfect on their own. Enjoy!
