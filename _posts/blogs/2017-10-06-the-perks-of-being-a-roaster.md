**What does a typical day at Pact Coffee look like for you?**

In the mornings, after cycling to work, it’s usually straight into cupping the
previous days roasts, which can be quite the caffeine hit after a big day of
roasting. Then I’ll start working on the day’s roasting which will mostly fill
the rest of the day. Scattered between the roasts I’ll try to make sure we
have a delivery truck full of coffee on the way to us.

**What measures do you put in place to ensure we send out the highest quality
coffee?**

We can’t take all the credit. The assurance of quality starts all the way at
the farm. It takes a lot of effort for each of our farmers to produce coffee
that can be marketed as Specialty Grade. The farmers ensure we only receive
the ripest, defect-free beans that have been processed to a high standard.

Once we receive them at the Pact Grindhouse we have our own quality control
procedures in place. Testing the green beans before roasting and then tasting
each batch to ensure consistency and quality. Then finally, we make sure every
bean is shipped within 7 days of roasting. Usually it’s only two!

**How long have you been at Pact?**

It’s two years this month.

**How did you come to be a roaster?**

When I started working at Pact I was working to help both the Grindhouse and
the Coffee Team. Splitting my time equally between the teams. I was helping to
grind, pack and ship 4-5,000 bags of coffee on a Monday, then finishing my
week helping the Coffee Team roast 24 plus bags on a Friday.

As the Coffee Team started needing more help they offered to take me on full
time and to teach me how to use the roaster too!

**What is the most challenging part of the job?**

It takes a lot to move a bag of coffee. They weigh between 60 and 70 kg each.
We roast around 5,000 kg each week. Stock movement day is not something I look
forward to!

**What has been the highlight of your time at Pact?**

Learning how to love coffee! When I joined the company I didn’t drink coffee.
The smell, the taste, I just never got into it. It was about six months before
I started drinking it. Straightaway I saw that everything I’d tried before was
terrible and this specialty coffee stuff wasn’t too bad. Now I drink it every
day for work and because I love it.

**What is your current favourite coffee and brew method?**

My current favourite coffee is La Laguna. But I think I’m a bit biased towards
the Micro Lots that come through the roastery. They are such small amounts and
have been produced with such care. We do many, many quality control tests to
try and find the perfect roast.

For brew method, I tend to stick with a V60 with 30g of coffee. Pour over
500ml of water then I’ve got a cup for myself and another to make friends
with!
