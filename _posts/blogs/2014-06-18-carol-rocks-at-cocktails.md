This week’s figurative gold star goes to Carol a.k.a.
[@cazzastrophe](https://twitter.com/cazzastrophe), she’s a Pact customer,
something of a foodie and a total cocktail aficionado. Carol has not only sent
us a belter of a recipe but a Vine video to go with it and a load of tips
about the science behind the cocktail.

This girl really knows her stuff.

**Inspired by Bibi.  
** “I was inspired by the flavour notes in the Bibi, so I wanted a cocktail
recipe that plays around with them. Your description mentions molasses body, a
hint of pecans and light stone-fruit acidity; I definitely got something akin
to that – although the body reminded me more of a caramel smell and I didn’t
get that much nuttiness coming through.”

**Brewing the coffee.**  
“Bars like the one I work in tend to prefer cold brew in cold coffee cocktails
because it seems something about going from hot to cold affects the chemistry
of the coffee and kind of gives it a stale flavour. If your palate really
can’t do without the bite from hot brew, though, I would mix half hot and half
cold.

**Coffee ♥ gin  
** “People tend to think that vodka is the ideal spirit to pair with coffee
because it’s a neutral spirit whereas gin isn’t. After all, espresso martinis
are made with vodka. However gin’s botanicals play really nicely with the
fruit in this drink, and so long as you pick a nicely balanced gin (nothing
too heavy on juniper or citrus) it’ll taste great. I’ve got a Sipsmith bias
myself but Beefeater would probably work nicely too.

If you don’t have gin or just hate gin (or if you’re working with a difficult
coffee), substitute it with a decent vodka and it’ll still be pretty lovely.
Chase makes a nice potato vodka with a creamy mouthfeel, which would be divine
in this drink.”

**Carol’s B.E.G. Cocktail  
** (B.E.G. stands for Berries, Espresso and Gin)

**Ingredients  
** 4 blackberries (a small handful)  
I added a couple of blueberries just for kicks  
1-2 shots Pact coffee (1 shot if it’s espresso strength more if it’s less
punchy) – I used Bibi  
A double shot of gin  
15ml freshly squeezed orange juice  
Splash of simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar)

**Method  
** 1\. Muddle the berries in a mixing glass to get a nice fresh puree. Add all
the rest of your ingredients, ice your cocktail shaker and shake until well
mixed (the outside of your shaker will be nice and cold when it’s ready).  
2\. Taste and adjust with simple syrup/orange juice/coffee as needed.  
3\. Fine or double-strain with a tea strainer into a tumbler with ice for a
smooth drink  
OR if you aren’t picky about pulp and seeds, omit the tea strainer bit and
simply strain out the ice.  
4\. Garnish with fruit – I used half an orange wheel and some blackberries.

**CAROL’S TIP:** For something a little different, swap out regular orange
juice for blood orange juice and mix things up by using blueberries instead of
blackberries as well.

The final drink will have a lovely shade of purple, which will vary depending
on your coffee. A lot of people over-shake or over-dilute, so be careful. You
don’t want insipid purple water.

**Carol’s final word on the matter…**

Depending on the coffee you use, the sweetness or tartness of your fruit and
even the gin you choose, amounts can (and should) be tweaked. I like subtle
flavours some days and a bit more of an in-your-face drink on other days. My
“just right” finished product however tends to taste like fruit with a
definite coffee depth, is refreshing and is sweet but not overly so. Your
palate will vary, so your ‘just right’ balance may be different to mine.
