Those who like ambling through the sillier neighbourhoods of the internet,
will doubtless have heard of the **[The Cinnamon
Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cinnamon+Challenge)**.
Well, since we started stocking the brilliant Mexican coffee, **[El
Retiro](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=menu&utm_content=cinnamon)**
, we’ve taken a leaf out of the Mexican coffee drinking book and so we’ve
devised a Cinnamon Challenge of our own.

It turns out that Mexican coffee drinkers like to add a small amount of
cinnamon to their ground coffee before brewing, which they find adds a
distinct flavour and softens the acidity. So we brewed up a couple of
cafetieres of **[El
Retiro](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=menu&utm_content=cinnamon)**
– one with cinnamon and one without – and found out what the team thought:

**Georgia (writes our blog posts and emails)**  
Without cinnamon: “Hazelnut-fest. Will’s nailed it with that one, the flavour
is really strong.”  
With cinnamon: “I like it. With a frothy milk I think I’d prefer it even.”

**Junta (comes up with snappy ads)**  
Without cinnamon: “Nice and sweet.”  
With cinnamon: “Woah! Cinnamon challenge! It’s too overpowering. Just tastes
like cinnamon water.”

**Stephen (is the big boss)  
** Without cinnamon: “Orangey not too acidic. Like a chocolate orange.”  
With cinnamon: “While I’m usually opposed to flavoured coffees, this is
lovely. It doesn’t taste artificial at all. The cinnamon actually works really
well with the hazelnuts. And because it’s not a ‘flavoured coffee’ it tastes
natural, like it’s just been kissed by the cinnamon.”

**Sam (calls up to check people like their coffee)**  
Without cinnamon: “Nice, savoury, nutty.”  
With cinnamon: “Weird. The cinnamon just fizzles on your tongue at the very
end.”

**Brendan (answers your emails)**  
Without cinnamon: “Mmmmm. But that could be the chewing gum I just had.”  
With cinnamon:  <Shakes head> “Nope.”

**Richard (finds new Pact customers)  
** Without cinnamon: “Nice. I like that”  
With cinnamon: “Ooh hello! Cheeky. And… I don’t actually like it. It tastes
like a bedtime drink rather than a proper coffee.”

**Will (our Head of Coffee)**  
Without cinnamon: “I get waves of hazelnut flavour along with caramel
sweetness, a rich creamy praline-like mouthfeel and a very mild creamy
acidity.”  
With cinnamon: “Urgh. Not a big fan of cinnamon. But the flavours do work well
together. I’ve got to give it that.”

****Christiaan (makes sure you’re liking what we’re doing)  
**** Without cinnamon: “Yes that’s coffee.”  
With cinnamon: “Mmm, it’s okay. I think it’d be nicer with milk.” “Wowsers,
that’s blown my mind.”
