Yes, it’s that time of year again. The days are shorter and darker, the coffee
is hotter and winter is setting in. As you sit and sip on your delicious cup
of Pact coffee, you can’t help think that something’s missing? But what…

**Cake, of course!**

But there are so many types of cake, “where do I even start” you cry?! Well,
luckily we’ve done the legwork for you and have found a cake that will
compliment your coffee as well as Simon does Garfunkel (before they split, of
course).

After a good long think as to what would go with our delicious [Planalto
coffee from Brazil](http://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees), we found the perfect
recipe to bring out its malt milk chocolate flavours! Here goes:

**Ingredients:**

1/3 cup butter

1/3 cup brown sugar

6 small cooking apples, halved, stems removed, cored

1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour

2/3 cup granulated sugar

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp ground ginger

1 tsp ground cinnamon

2/3 cup milk

1/4 cup butter, softened

1 egg

1 teaspoon vanilla

**Instructions:**

  * Get started by preheating the oven to 170°C.
  * Place 1/3 cup butter in a 9x9x2 inch baking pan and pop it in the oven until the butter melts. 
  * Once melted, remove from oven and add the sugar, then give it a good stir. 
  * Next up, arrange 9 apple halves in the mixture any way you like – this is your chance to be as creative as you wish – and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture bubbles! 
  * Meanwhile, peel remaining apples and coarsely shred them; set aside. The shredded apple is going to have a lot of water in it, which is fine!
  * In a bowl combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, ginger and cinnamon.
  * To that mixture add the shredded apple, milk, 1/4 cup butter, egg and vanilla. Whisk until combined and spoon over the apples.
  * Spread the mixture evenly (apple may be exposed and some butter may come to surface, that’s okay!).
  * Bake for 35 minutes or until a wooden toothpick or skewer inserted near centre comes out clean.
  * Let it cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes, before loosening the edges; invert onto platter.
  * Spoon any topping left over in the pan over the top and arrange those extra bits of caramelised apple from earlier on the top if you wish. Et voila! ![cake 1](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cake-1-e1447332286369-936x1024.jpg).

**George’s baking tips:**

It’s a good idea to not leave the cake cooling for too long as you risk it
sticking to the pan. Five minutes is long enough for it to cool. If you’re not
eating it until later or the next day, still turn it out 5 minutes after
cooling and then box and refrigerate it once fully cooled.

And don’t forget to brew a cup of Planalto to enjoy with it!

**George’s BONUS baking tips:**

I caramelised a couple of extra bits of apple and put them aside to decorate
the top of it once it was baked. Stupidly, I used a springform pan to
caramelise the apples and very hot butter went EVERYWHERE. So just use a
normal, non-detachable cake tin folks!
