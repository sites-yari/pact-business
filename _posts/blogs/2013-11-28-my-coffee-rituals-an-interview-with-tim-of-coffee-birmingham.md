**Whatâ€™s your name and Twitter handle?**

Tim Wilson [@timmy666](http://www.twitter.com/timmy666) or
[@coffeebrum](http://www.twitter.com/coffeebrum)

**How long have you been with Pact?**

Since the Summer.

**Whatâ€™s your favourite brew method?**

Hario Drip Pot.

**Whatâ€™s your favourite time of day to make a coffee, and why?**

Mid-morning. A few hours into my work, thereâ€™s nothing better than to get up
and get a coffee on the go.

**Who introduced you to coffee?**

I introduced myself really! Just got a flavour for it, then really started to
immerse myself in the experience â€“ going to indie coffee shops, roasters,
baristas, brew methods â€“ the whole thing!

**On what day does your coffee taste best, and why?**

At the weekend, sharing espressos/piccolos and brews with my girlfriend each
Saturday and Sunday morning. Itâ€™s a romantic thing!

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**

I like to rock out with my Rok Espresso Machine but Iâ€™m not overly specific.

**Who would be your favourite celebrity, dead or alive, to make a coffee
for?**

I donâ€™t have a favourite celebrity as such. Saying that, Iâ€™d love to make a
coffee for Roger Taylor of Queen as heâ€™s the guy that got me into drumming! ðŸ™‚

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**

When youâ€™re feeling down or having a hard time, thereâ€™s nothing quite like a
good coffee.

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**

I think coffee is a super fuel. It gives me a lot of the powers I need. Are
they super? Iâ€™ll leave that to others to decide. Pact Coffee is a super power
all of its own though ðŸ™‚
