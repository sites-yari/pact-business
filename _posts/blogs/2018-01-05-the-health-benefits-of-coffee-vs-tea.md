brew?

It can be the kind of question that divides a room. The kind of question that
makes you question who you really are. The kind of question that, when people
answer, makes you wonder whether you ever really knew them at all.

Are you more of a coffee or a tea drinker?

Of course there are also people who like both equally…

But now the New Year is here and we’re all turning over a healthy new leaf (as
per in January), it’s not just a case of what you like; we also have to
consider what our bodies like. So here it is, laid out nice and clearly, three
excellent reasons to treat yourself to whichever hot beverage your heart
desires:

**The top 3 health benefits of drinking coffee.**

**1\. Coffee may help protect against type 2 diabetes.** In 2014 The Harvard
School of Public Health (HSPH) gathered data from questionnaires completed
every 4 years. The data established that participants who increased their
coffee intake by more than one cup per day (1.69 cups on average) over a
4-year period had an 11% lower type 2 diabetes risk.

As Dr. Simin Liu – one of the authors of the study – put it, there’s an
“inverse association” between coffee consumption and risk for type 2 diabetes.

**2\. Coffee could lower your risk of liver disease and some forms of
cancer.** This is according to The British Medical Journal, which also
reported that you have less chance of dying from a stroke if you drink coffee
in moderation, though researchers could not prove coffee was the direct cause
when the study was conducted.

It’s also important to point out that pregnant women should consume no more
than 200mg of caffeine a day, though of course they can always switch to
[decaffeinated](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees?decaf=true) if they find
they’re missing the flavour of really good coffee.

**3\. Coffee could reduce your risk of getting heart problems.** When
University of Southampton researchers collected data on the impact of coffee
on all aspects of the human body they found that, compared with non-coffee
drinkers, those who drank about three cups of coffee a day appeared to be at
lower risk when it came to heart problems.

Prof Paul Roderick, from the faculty of medicine at the University of
Southampton said “There is a balance of risks in life, and the benefits of
moderate consumption of coffee seem to outweigh the risks.”.

**The top 3 health benefits of drinking tea.**

**1\. Tea may help to prevent some types of cancer.** Though research is in
its infancy, results seem to suggest that the antioxidants in tea, including
polyphenols and catechins, may help prevent some specific
[cancers](https://www.webmd.boots.com/cancer/default.htm). For example, early
studies show that women who regularly drink black tea have a much lower risk
of [ovarian cancer](https://www.webmd.boots.com/ovarian-cancer/default.htm)
than women who don’t (though more research is needed to confirm this).

Claire Williamson of the British Nutrition Foundation said: “[…] more studies
need to be done. But there are definite potential health benefits from the
polyphenols in terms of reducing the risk of diseases such as heart disease
and cancers.”

**2\. Tea could help cut your chances of having a heart attack.** Public
health nutritionist Dr Carrie Ruxton, and her colleagues at King’s College
London, have found clear evidence to suggest that drinking three to four cups
of tea a day can reduce the risk of suffering from a heart attack. They also
came across other health benefits, including protection against tooth plaque
and the strengthening of bones.

As Dr Ruxton said: “Drinking tea is actually better for you than drinking
water. Water is essentially replacing fluid. Tea replaces fluids and contains
antioxidants so it’s got two things going for it.”

**3\. Herbal teas offer a range of health benefits.** Susan Curtis, a
homeopath for Neals Yard Remedies, suggests that herbal teas containing real
herbs “make effective remedies if drunk at least three to four times a day”,
going on to advise that “the best quality herbal teas tend to be organic.”

To give you a few examples; Ginger’s warming effects are said to relieve
rheumatic aches and pains, by widening the blood vessels and stimulating
circulation. Peppermint is renowned for settling the stomach, since it
stimulates bile production in the gall bladder, thus breaking down fat in the
digestive system. And green tea is high in antioxidants, compounds produced in
the body that protect the cells from damage from things like pollutants.

**More good news…**
