Since she has gone to all the trouble of creating you, virtually from scratch,
it seems only right that you pay homage to your mum at least once a year. And
to do so with some gusto. So this Mother’s Day (30th March) make a stand
against rubbish presents and get her something decent.

**Something decent**  
We all know that a [Pact Coffee
subscription](https://www.pactcoffee.com/gifts/new) is the perfect Mother’s
Day gift. That’s obvious. After all you can choose how many deliveries your
mum receives and there’ll even be a note in with her first delivery, which you
can personalise with some mega-thoughtful message.

**Five Mother’s Day pitfalls  
** Beware Mother’s Day gift-shopper, because amongst really good presents (see
above) there are some really, really bad ones and they’re just waiting to
catch you out. “It seemed like a good idea at the time” and “I thought you’d
think it was funny” are not decent defences when you’re staring into the cold,
hard eyes of an unimpressed mum. There are five pitfalls you may want to avoid
below…

**1.[Spanx](http://www.spanx.co.uk/shop/?gclid=CP7n0P3_mb0CFY_ItAod-BMANQ)**  
The name itself should be enough of a giveaway. Control pants have their place
but it isn’t sitting, gift wrapped on your mum’s lap on the morning of
Mothering Sunday.

**2.[Wine Bottle Toilet Brush  
](http://www.geniegadgets.com/wine-bottle-toilet-
brush.html?gclid=CKmVoKjlmb0CFWLHtAodRjMA3w)** Haha! It looks like a wine
bottle! But it’s actually a toilet brush! This is not a joke. It’s an insult.

**3.[ Girls Glitter Tattoo Party Kit  
](http://www.temporarytattoostore.co.uk/product/party-kit-girls/)** We’re
talking glitter, brushes and tattoos in the shape of butterflies, kittens and
the word ‘diva’. Now all you need is a recipient aged 13 or under…

**4.[Naked Chef Apron  
](http://mphomewares.co.uk/acatalog/REAL-Naked-Chef-Novelty-Sexy-Apron--
3098.html)** Here’s a simple rule of thumb. Don’t ever get your mother a gift
that’s even remotely associated with nudity.

**5.[An Origami Nazgul](http://papercraft.wikidot.com/origami:lord-of-the-
rings-nazgul-origami-tutorial)**  
“I’ll give her something handmade,” you think. “She liked those ‘Lord of the
Rings’ films,” you think. Then you attempt to make her an origami Nazgul and
this happens…
