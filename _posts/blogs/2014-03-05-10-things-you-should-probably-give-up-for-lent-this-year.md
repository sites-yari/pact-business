10) Saying FYI (either seriously or with irony)

9) Stage managing your Facebook page to impress Facebook stalkers

8) Ordering takeaway pizza mostly because you can’t resist the pizza tracker

7) Pinning craft projects you’ll never even start ([or fail at all
together](http://www.boredpanda.com/funny-pinterest-fails/))

6) [Judging John
Travolta](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/low_concept/2014/03/john_travolta_called_idina_menzel_adele_dazeem_what_s_your_travolta_name.html)
for calling Idina Menzel “Adele Dazeem” at the Oscars

5) Eating salt and sweet popcorn (it tastes so good it must be bad)

4) Taking [quizzes](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kimberleydadds/which-famous-
person-should-you-get-drunk-with) to find out which celebrities you should go
drinking with

3) Complaining that The Voice is rubbish

2) Watching The Voice anyway

…and finally…

**1) Drinking instant coffee**
