title: "Learning from the master \u2013 a cafetiere class from Will"
---

The cafetiere has often been considered the people’s brew kit. It’s easy to
use and it’s incredibly easy to master. That’s why most people tend to cut
their teeth on the French press when they start out brewing. But that’s not to
say that Will, our Head of Coffee, hasn’t got a few cafetiere tips and tricks
up his sleeves.

At our latest coffee class held at Pact HQ, our customers took the plunge into
the world of cafetieres. Everyone who came along got some brilliant brewing
pointers from Will, as well as a free bag of coffee and a fancy-looking
KeepCup for those coffee-on-the-run moments.

_If you couldn’t make it then don’t worry. We filmed the whole thing and
popped it up on[Google Hangouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6T6wPK1740),
allowing you to join in at home – or even host your own Cafetiere
Masterclass._

**1\. Measure your coffee**

As with all our brew methods, we say to use 60g per one litre of water but we
understand that not everyone has scales or a coffee scoop to measure their
coffee.

So we did some calculations. A heaped teaspoon of coffee is about 5g, a
dessert spoon is 10g and a tablespoon is around 15g – now everyone can get the
right amount of coffee in their cafetiere. Once you have the measurements all
sorted, put the coffee in your cafetiere and put the kettle on the boil.

**2\. Not too hot**

For the water to have the perfect amount of energy, it should be around 94
degrees. So when you boil your water, leave it to stand for a minute before
pouring it into your cafetiere.

**3\. Pouring & stirring**

Start your timer and pour in your water at a good rate so it covers all the
coffee. At about two minutes in, stir it a few times and add in a bit more
water if the level of coffee in your cafetiere goes down.

**4\. Scoop & Plunge**

At four minutes, scoop off the coffee granules on top of the coffee, place on
the lid and slowly push down the plunger.

Et voilà! You have amazing cafetiere coffee. Give it a go and drop us a
comment. We’d love to hear what you think.

Our next event is Espresso Yourself, an espresso coffee class on 4th September
from 8-9am. So, don’t forget to [get your
ticket](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/espresso-yourself-tickets-12795249937).

**A little bit extra:** We did write a guide for how to brew with your
cafetiere back in April, but with Will joining the team, the cafetiere coffee
class was a great chance for us to learn a bit more. We’ve made some changes
so everyone is on the same page!
