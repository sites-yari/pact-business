Remember how excruciating it was writing personal statements about yourself at
school? That’s what this feels like. I’ve been putting off writing an
‘Introducing… me’ blog post for a while now – I’d much rather write about the
rest of the team or our really really good coffee – but I could procrastinate
no longer.

So, I’m the wordy member of the content team. I work on our blog, our emails,
our website, the written stuff we send out with our coffee – and basically any
Pact stuff you read – teaming up with
[Anneliese](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/introducing-anneliese-and-
her-limited-edition-pact-tote-bags/ "Introducing Anneliese \(and her limited
edition Pact tote bags\)!") to make sure it all looks pretty.

I love working at Pact. Pact HQ is a really invigorating, buzzing place to
work (and that’s not just because there’s mind-blowing coffee on-tap),
everyone here really loves what they do. I know it sounds cheesy but so do
Queen songs, so I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing.

We try to mix it up on the blog, with frivolous bits and bobs as well as
proper grown-up information about our coffee. But my job here is to write
about stuff you’re interested in, so if you have any ideas or requests for
blog posts then drop me a mail on josie@pactcoffee.com

So now you know roughly what I do I’m going to take part in a strange slightly
Jekyll and Hyde Q&A with myself…

**A quick Q &A with Josie:**

**What do you do at Pact?**  
I’m the resident copywriter.

**What’s your favourite part of the working day (please don’t say home
time)?**  
The walk and talk meetings we have, which take in a local Polish supermarket –
weirdly called [St James
Supermarket](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?St_James_Supermarket,_SE16_3TX).
Right by the tills they have these phenomenal flatbreads filled with feta and
spinach, which are patently the second-most delicious things in Bermondsey.
Pact Coffee being the first, naturally.

**Tell us a bit about where you worked previously?**  
Since I first cut my teeth as a copywriter I’ve worked for various companies
including Sony, 118118, Waitrose and John Lewis. What I love about working for
a startup like Pact is that we’re small enough to be brave and try new things.
It’s like being in a smart little speed boat rather than in a lumbering ferry.

**[![Pact Coffee
Khaleesi](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_20140308_082427.jpg?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_20140308_082427.jpg)What
does your favourite mug look like?**  
A plain white mug that simply says ‘Khaleesi’ on it. When I give it to guests
some of them know and some of them don’t.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**  
[The Very Best of Toots & The
Maytals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btomXvCcbYo), every song is a classic.
The energy in this album is effervescent, which works as the perfect aural
accompaniment to a hot pot of coffee. Throw in some sunshine, a really comfy
sofa, my one-year-old playing in a happy self-contained way and some
newspapers and I am in heaven.

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**  
Flexible cloning, so there could be multiples of me, like in that heinous film
[Multiplicity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH2XDPI5664) starring Michael
Keaton. I’d then be able to reabsorb the clones when I didn’t need them, which
I think would help me to avoid the problems Michael Keaton encounters in the
film.
