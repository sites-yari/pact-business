According to legend, the humble cafetiere (or French press, as it’s sometimes
called) was invented as the direct result of a nagging wife. Apparently, the
husband in question used to go out for a walk every day to escape his wife’s
intolerable company. He would pack up some wood and an old coffee pot – so the
story goes – and head out into the woods.

****

One day, on one of these woodland retreats, the man forgot to add the coffee
grounds before the water in his pan had reached boiling point. He then found
that when he did add them they floated to the top of the water and didn’t mix
in properly.

The man was understandably crestfallen.

However, by happy coincidence, an Italian merchant was walking by. This
merchant just happened to be carrying an assortment of goods, including some
very fine metal mesh.

The two fell into conversation and suddenly the old man was struck with an
idea. A brilliant idea. He purchased a piece of metal mesh and proceeded to
plunge it down into his pot, using no more than a stick he found on the forest
floor. Just as the old man had envisaged, the floating coffee grounds were
pushed to the bottom of the pan.

The Italian merchant was impressed.

After both men had tried the coffee they agreed it was the finest they had
ever tasted. Then and there they decided to open a factory, which would
produce the first version of what is now known as the cafetiere.

During the following 150 years, the design for the cafetiere was improved and
refined through a series of patents. For one thing we no longer use twigs for
plungers. Then in the 1970s a French company called Martin S.A. launched the
cafetiere in the UK, under the name La Cafetiere.

A later partnership with Bodum saw huge growth in the number of people using
the cafetiere to brew their coffee. It is now the brewing method of choice for
millions of people across the UK, who all incidentally lived happily ever
after.
