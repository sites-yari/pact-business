“We’re all going on a summer holiday” your colleagues crow, waving condensed
guides to Costa Rica and ASOS packages full of flip-flops and swimwear in your
face. But you don’t let it bother you. Instead of seeking sun, sand and
sensual experiences somewhere far away, you’re packing up your 50l hiking
rucksack (you know, the one you used once for Duke of Edinburgh and never
again) and getting ready to join the camping… camp.

Maybe you’re dragging the kids to Cornwall for a body-boarding and boardgame-
based break, maybe you’re reliving your youth by finally finding out what this
festival thing is all about. Either way, you’re going to need two things: a
tent and some good coffee.

Think about it – in one scenario you’ll be up until the small hours, shaking
_all_ of your things and feeling rather the worse for wear for it the next
morning. In the other, you’ve somehow found the most uneven and rock-studded
piece of grass to sleep on and are on permanent ‘stop your offspring
smothering each other with their sleeping bags’ duty. After all that, you’re
going to wake up in desperate need for a cup of something hot, strong and just
generally delicious.

“But Pact!”, you cry. “I can hardly bring my espresso machine with me!”. Well,
worry not – we’ve worked out the very best way to get your cup of joe on the
go. And without resigning yourself to the dreaded motorway services sachet
coffee!

**Here’s what you’re going to need:**

  * An [aeropress](https://www.pactcoffee.com/shop/aerobie-aeropress)
  * Some bloody great [coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)

And that _could_ be it, but we know what you’re like. You like all the bells
and whistles, you with your carefully curated collection of coffee ‘gear’. So
we’ve come up with a few more travel-friendly gadgets just to make that dewy,
fresh-out-of-the-tent cup of coffee even better.

  * [Travel grinder](https://www.pactcoffee.com/shop/rhinowares-mini-hand-grinder)
  * [Dry bag](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=small+dry+bags&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd_sl_68logpmxg4_e&adgrpid=56946876367&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259045957173&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9242011563115232139&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045885&hvtargid=kwd-295421441462), to keep those grounds fresh
  * [Reusable filter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stainless-Coffee-AeroPress-Home-Revolution/dp/B0063SL2TQ) to cut down on space and waste  

**Got it? Then just follow these steps:**

  1. Bringing your own beans? Then get grinding! Using the attachment that comes with our mini grinder, you can do it straight into your aeropress.
  2. Boil some water: pocket rocket, fully-fledged camping stove, firepit – we’ll leave this one up to you.
  3. Follow our Aeropress brewing guide [here](https://www.pactcoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress)! 
  4. Sink into your camping chair and enjoy…

It’s super-duper simple, and probably the easiest way to drink speciality
coffee when you’re on the go. Besides – just because you’ve downgraded from a
two-bed semi to a no-bed leaky tent, why should you compromise on taste?

Happy staycationing, Pact people!
