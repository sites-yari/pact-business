**If you’re keen to get to grips with speciality coffee, then learning the
basics of beans is a good place to start. We grilled our Head of Coffee, Will
Corby about the two main species of coffee and why he’s Team Arabica all the
way.**

First off, did you know there are four different species of coffee bean?
Excelsa and liberica are basically inedible and the tiny amount of coffee they
produce is bitter and flavourless. Then there are robusta and arabica, the two
big players in the coffee bean arena. Here at Pact we only ever buy arabica
beans. It’s something
[Will](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/06/16/introducing-will/), our Head of
Coffee, feels extremely strongly about. Here’s why…

**

Meet robusta. It’s a hippopotamus of a coffee. It’s heavy-duty, powerful and
plentiful but lacking in finesse.

The reason for these blunt, punchy characteristics is that robusta grows on
great plains between sea level and 800 metres above sea level. At this
altitude conditions are warmer and so the trees grow faster. That means they
deliver a higher yield in a shorter space of time, but they do so at the
expense of delicate flavours.

Obviously robusta is cheap to produce, so cheaper to buy. That’s why it’s
sometimes used to ‘bulk out’ an arabica coffee, thereby increasing the profit
margins of the coffee companies who choose to use it.

**

Meet arabica. It’s a samurai of a coffee. Its flavours are both delicate and
quietly powerful. There are hundreds of varietals of this elegant species,
each of which has either come into being naturally over decades or carefully
through lab-based cross-pollination.

Arabica grows on picturesque plots high in the mountains, between 800 and 2000
metres above sea level. Temperatures here range from just 15°C to no higher
than 22°C, so the coffee trees’ rate of growth is slower. This allows the
beans to develop subtle sweetness and aromatic flavours, which will differ
depending on the variety of arabica and the location of the farm.

As you might imagine, growing arabica is far more costly than growing robusta,
and requires far more expertise. Their mountainous home makes picking arabica
cherries much harder, since it all has to be done by hand. There are also
fewer cherries per tree and transporting the green beans from the farm via
mountain passes is more costly too. But all the effort and expense is worth it
when it comes to getting a cup in your hands. Freshly roasted, freshly ground
and freshly brewed, this stuff is the cat’s pyjamas.

grow?

So as you can see, comparing robusta to arabica is a bit like comparing a Ford
and a Porsche. It’s like grape juice versus a fine wine. It’s rubbish coffee
versus really excellent coffee. And – as you know – we don’t deal in rubbish
coffee.
