![lolly](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lolly.jpg?w=300)Enter
the ice age with this frosty treat.

I believe it was the great poet Andre 3000 who once said, “what’s cooler, than
being cool? Ice cold”.

I don’t mean to read between the lines here, but I’m pretty sure he was
talking about coffee.

We’ve given you a [minty cold
brew](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/05/21/pact-mint-cold-brew/ "Pact ‘Mint
Velvets’ Cold Brew"), but how about we take this party from the fridge to the
freezer?

Our designer, [Anneliese](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/introducing-
anneliese-and-her-limited-edition-pact-tote-bags/ "Introducing Anneliese \(and
her limited edition Pact tote bags\)!"), delighted us by whipping up some
coffee ice lollies and, as you can imagine, it was dead simple and even
deadlier delish.

All she did was brew up her latest bag of [Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) (with just a touch of sugar) and
whacked them in the freezer.

Hey presto! Coffee ice lollies. Go on. Give it a go! (And if you don’t have
any of those handy moulds like Anneliese, just have a look
