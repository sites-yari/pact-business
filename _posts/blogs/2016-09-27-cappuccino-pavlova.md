Advice from George: Use espresso instead/ ground coffee

The instant espresso powder (do not use instant coffee granules) gives bitter
oomph to the sweet, marshmallowy meringue, which I make with Two Chicks’ free-
range egg whites.

Serves: 8-10

## INGREDIENTS

  * 250g caster sugar
  * 4 teaspoons instant espresso powder (not instant coffee granules)
  * 4 large egg whites
  * 1 pinch of salt
  * 2 teaspoons cornflour
  * 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
  * 300 millilitres double cream
  * 1 teaspoon cocoa powder

## METHOD

  1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4/350°F. Line a flat oven sheet with baking parchment and, using a 23cm/9inch cake tin, draw a circle on it.
  2. Mix the sugar with the instant espresso powder in a small bowl and set aside.
  3. In a clean, grease-free metal bowl whisk the egg whites and salt until they are holding soft peaks. Keep whisking while you add the sugar-coffee mixture a tablespoon at a time.
  4. When you have a firm, ecru-coloured meringue, fold in the cornflour and vinegar using a grease-free metal spoon.Dollop the meringue mixture inside the drawn circle. Smooth and shape it with a spatula so that it looks rather like the crown of a boater: it must be flat on top.
  5. Put it in the oven and immediately turn down to 150°C/gas mark 3/300°F and cook for an hour. Switch off the oven and leave inside until cool.
  6. Once the base is cool, lift it carefully in its paper and place it top-side down on a flat plate and peel off the paper.
  7. Whip the double cream until thick but soft and spread delicately over the top of the meringue. With a teaspoon, push the cocoa through a fine sieve or tea strainer to decorate the top, cappuccino-style.

Then bring it to the International Coffee Day and… Enjoy!
