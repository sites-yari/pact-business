title: Five coffee-making tips for Michael Caine
---

He’s looks excellent in a suit. He can rock oversized glasses. He has been a
dedicated and selfless manservant to Bruce Wayne. And he has masterminded the
thievery of some serious Chinese gold from an Italian bank. But one thing it
seems Michael Caine cannot do, is make a decent coffee…

An anonymous caller (thanks whoever you are) tipped us off about the opening
titles to _The Ipcress Files_ and said we should take a look. We did, and the
bright star that is Mr Caine was suddenly dimmed somewhat. We guess he was
distracted by some espionage or something – but here’s a list of how his
coffee-making technique could be improved…

  1. **He uses a blade grinder**  
These tend to produce inconsistently sized grounds, which result in a somewhat
ropey flavour. He’d be better off using a burr grinder (which doesn’t use
blades to chop the coffee up) or – better yet – order his coffee freshly-
ground.

  2. **He doesn’t measure out the coffee**  
Now it could be that M.C. has been through this routine so many times that his
clumsy man-hands know exactly how much coffee is required for his morning
brew. But we doubt it.

  3. **Dangerous plug socket**  
This one isn’t coffee-related, just a general health and safely tip. That plug
socket is pretty much hanging off the wall, which tends to be bad for one’s
health.

  4. **Water cooling**  
This is a thumbs up. The boiling water is left to cool for a while, before
it’s added to the coffee. As Michael is obviously aware, adding freshly boiled
water would scald the coffee.

  5. **Immediate plunging**  
This is the most heinous of the crimes Caine commits in this short piece of
footage. Instead of leaving the coffee to steep and for the flavour to emerge,
it is immediately plunged and poured. As Gabi, our Head of Coffee points out,
he doesn’t give the water enough time to pull the flavour and goodness out of
the coffee. Poor, poor coffee.
