**It’s true. As well as helping us humans to get up and at ‘em, caffeine has
developed through evolution to deter insects from eating coffee trees and the
like. Dubious? Read on…**

plantation in Brazil

As anyone who knows [the difference between robusta and
arabica](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2016/05/18/whats-the-difference-between-
arabica-and-robusta/) will tell you, arabica grows at higher altitudes on
mountainous plantations, while robusta hangs out around sea level. They’ll
also tell you that robusta beans contain around twice as much caffeine as
arabica beans. How are the two connected? Simple.

Insects.

Insects prefer mild conditions to cool mountain terrain. They’re just not that
rugged. Indeed, when Will (our Head of Coffee) goes on his coffee buying
trips, he only needs to wear insect repellant when he arrives and leaves via
the airport. During the time he’s up in the mountainous regions, meeting
specialty coffee farmers and sourcing arabica, he doesn’t wear a single spritz
of it.

Turns out that while mountainous arabica plants haven’t had to adapt to live
among swarms of insects, robusta plants have. They’ve found over the years
that caffeine deters little critters from trying to eat them, so they’ve made
sure they’re chocker with the stuff.

As an aside, wondering why we don’t use caffeine as an insecticide for plants
or an insect repellant for people? We did too; it turns out UV light degrades
caffeine, plus it’s very water soluble. So if it’s merely sprayed onto a plant
it would either be burned off or washed away by rain; it wouldn’t last long
enough to make any difference.

So, next time you’re enjoying the day’s first caffeine hit, remember you have
insects to thank for it.
