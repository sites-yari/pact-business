title: How to look good drinking coffee
---

Champagne is cliche, milkshakes are too squeaky clean and fruit juice plays
havoc with one’s tooth enamel. That’s why the drink of choice amongst icons in
the know is none other than coffee. A good cup of java held in just the right
way and sipped with just the right amount of casual panache looks really
freaking cool.

So let’s look at some icons of stage and screen, to learn from them about the
best way to work that cup…

James Dean: Coffee and glasses always look good together. Here, this winning
combination says ‘I’m intelligent but I’m also really good looking’. The
single digit hold isn’t easy to pull off but is worth working at to achieve a
certain delicate nonchalance.

Audrey Hepburn & George Peppard: Unlike us mere mortals, the captivating
Audrey demonstrates here that she can pull off the ‘missed my face with the
cup’ look. Even if she poured that coffee down her front she’d still look
terrific. As for Peppard, this snap was taken before he graduated onto cigars
(as Hannibal in The A-Team) but he still looks pretty dapper thanks to his
excellent handling of the saucer, which might feminise a less confident man.

Frank Sinatra: Ol’ Blue Eyes is rocking a tiny cup and a power stance here,
which is no mean feat. The fact that his head is dipped down over the cup
means he’s looking up from under his brows; always a flattering angle. Clever
Frank.

Marilyn Monroe: A wide-brimmed coffee cup such as this may be excellent in
terms of flavour but it can be a minefield for spillages. Her smart use of
both hands means Marilyn will dodge the dreaded spill but also retains her
sophistication thanks to the coquettish angle of her hands.

The ‘Some Like it Hot’ star also uses the cup to mask some of her face
provocatively, much as ladies would have used fans in ye olden days.

Andy Warhol: Despite the rather camp hand on hip and teeny handle, there are
no pinkies on display here. The effect is neat and focussed. Warhol’s direct
gaze over the brim denotes power and self-assuredness. Nice.
