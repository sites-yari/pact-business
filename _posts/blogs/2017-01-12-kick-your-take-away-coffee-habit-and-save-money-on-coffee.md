title: Kick your take away coffee habit and save money on coffee
---

# Here are our top reasons to kick that high street coffee habit…

### You could save £500 a year

When you crunch the numbers on your daily high street coffee habit, you’ll
notice that those £2 take away coffees really add up. A cup of coffee from a
bag of freshly roasted Pact Coffee works out to cost 50p per cup. So even if
you only drink one coffee a day at work, you’ll save yourself nearly £500 a
year! What will you buy with the money you’ve saved by ditching those takeaway
coffees… A new bike? A flashy camera? Or a weekend away in Europe?

Here, we’ve even done the maths for you on the savings:

Number of Coffees | Weekly Savings | Annual Savings  
---|---|---  
5 per week | £8.50 | £442.00  
7 per week or 1 per day | £11.90 | £618.80  
14 per week or 2 per day | £23.80 | £1,237.60  
**18 per week* or 2.6 per day** | **£30.60** | **£1,591.20**  
  
_*You’ve told us that on average you have 18 cups of coffee a week_

### No more rushing

Let’s face it, your morning commute can be stressful enough without battling
the crowds for a cup of coffee. It’s an age-old tale: you line up at your
local coffee shop, nervously check your watch (again), then run like the wind
to catch your bus or get into the office before someone has noticed you’re
late! Sometimes you make it, other times you end up with a brown stain on your
shirt. You could save yourself the hassle and time by making your own coffee
at home or in your office kitchen. And to all you naysayers, it really does
only take 5 minutes to make a cuppa yourself (see below).

### Enjoy incredible coffee, every day

When it comes to high street coffee, the quality just doesn’t stand up. Most
of the time your beans are burnt, tasteless or just not quite right. A bad
coffee can ruin your day, so why take that risk? Brewing your own cup of Pact
will produce a consistently great-tasting cup of coffee every day. That’s
because it’s made by you, just the way you like it.

## “But it takes too long to make my own coffee, it’s much more convenient to
buy it”

Really? Let’s work it out:

Will, our Head of Coffee, highly recommends using a cafetiere or [Clever
Dripper](https://www.pactcoffee.com/shop/clever-dripper) for hands-off coffee
brewing. Both brew methods require minimal effort and minimal supervision, all
it takes is a little bit of practise before getting your coffee brewing
routine down to just a few minutes.

First, you need hot water. Second, pop your ground coffee into your cafetiere
or Clever Dripper. Third, let it brew for 3 minutes. Finally, pour your
freshly brewed coffee into a travel mug, and add sugar and milk, if that’s how
you like your coffee. It really is that simple! This is definitely less time
than it takes to travel to your local coffee shop, stand in line, order, pay
and wait for your drink to made. Plus, the time that you’ve saved means you
can pop out of the office and enjoy a good ol’ walk.
