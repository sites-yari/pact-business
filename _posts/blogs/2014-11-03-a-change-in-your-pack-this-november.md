title: A change in your pack this November
---

As of the start of November, there’ll be a little something extra that we’ll
be including in our packs of coffee, so we wanted to tell you more about it.

As you know, we’re on a mission to get the UK drinking better coffee, but that
doesn’t come easy, especially since we’re still a very young company (we
celebrated our second birthday the other week). One of the ways we let people
know we exist is by using flyers. You’ll probably know this already, as most
of our existing customers have discovered us via a flyer.

When it comes to getting these flyers out, we tend to rely quite heavily on
start-up camaraderie. This basically means working with companies we love, of
varying sizes, promoting to each-other’s customers.

So, as of November, your packs of coffee will contain flyers for companies we
like and – more importantly – that we think will you’ll like. All will include
an offer for you, and where possible we’ve negotiated this to be exclusive, or
at least out of the ordinary.

This will allow us to be promoted by these brands in return. The more promoted
we are, the more people we get drinking fresh Pact coffee. And you get to feel
a bit chuffed that you were one of the early adopters in what we hope will be
Britain’s most loved coffee company.

Now you know what we’re planning it’s over to you. We really don’t want to
annoy anyone with offers they don’t want, so we’d welcome feedback on this new
development (you can use the comment box below if you like). If there’s
someone we promote that you really don’t think is a good fit, then let us know
because we are listening.

_This is my first post here on the Pact blog, so wanted to quickly introduce
myself as well. I’m Josh and I help find new customers for Pact through print
marketing._
