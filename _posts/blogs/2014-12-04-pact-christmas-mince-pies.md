**Here’s a Christmas joke for you:**

Ok, well that joke was a little disappointing, but hopefully this recipe for
Christmas mince pies can make it up to you.

It’s an easy method to master. So, if you need to distract any children
loitering around the presents under your Christmas tree, this is your chance
to get them in the kitchen to help out.

Their hands will be busy kneading dough, instead of rattling all the gifts
they’re getting this year. Then all you’ll need to do is [make sure you’ve got
enough Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/users/sign_in) to go enjoy with
your Christmas mince pies.

**Ingredients**

225g cold butter (diced)  
350g plain flour  
100g golden caster sugar  
280g mincemeat  
1 small egg  
Icing sugar (for dusting)

**Method**

  1. Begin by preheating the oven to 180℃ or gas mark 6.
  2. In a large mixing bowl, rub the butter and flour together. Mix in golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt. Roll the whole thing in a ball and knead for about a minute. The pastry should be firm enough to use straight away, but it can also be chilled for later.
  3. Divide the pastry into thirds, use two thirds to line patty tins. Spoon mincemeat mixture into the patties.
  4. Using slightly less pastry than you did to line the patty tin, shape some slightly smaller balls to make round lids. They should be big enough to cover the pies. Press the edges gently to seal the lids – they will seal properly as they bake. Use the egg to brush the tops of the pies.
  5. Stick them in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool for five minutes before lightly dusting them with icing sugar.
