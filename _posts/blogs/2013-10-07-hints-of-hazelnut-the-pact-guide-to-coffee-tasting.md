In this blog post, we’re going to guide you through a basic cupping (the fancy
way of saying a tasting). There’s no right or wrong ways of cupping, but we
hope this will be a good start!

The first thing you’ll need to do is get some medium grind coffee, and put it
into a small glass or a bowl. Then, get some water that’s just off the boil
and pour it over. Here you want to use the golden ratio of coffee brewing,
which is 60g of coffee per litre of water (so if you’ve got 15g of coffee,
you’ll want to use 250ml of water).

Once the water is in, leave it to infuse for 3-4 minutes. While this is
happening, you’ll want to take a look at the chart below. It’s what we’re
going to use for finding flavours!
