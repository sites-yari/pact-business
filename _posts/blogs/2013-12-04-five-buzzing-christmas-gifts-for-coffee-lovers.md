title: Five Buzzing Christmas Gifts for Coffee Lovers
---

Forget socks, ditch bubble bath and hang your head in shame if you’ve even
considered buying someone gym membership for Christmas.

Predictable Christmas gifts are simply not to be tolerated this year,
especially if the recipient has a proclivity for coffee. This selection of
gifts for coffee-lovers will save you the bother of being thoughtful, while
winning you some serious brownie points.

Talk-8w4_Pillow#25=193&18=126)** What says ‘Merry Christmas’ like a vaguely
threatening throw pillow? This yellow cuddle-cushion features a plucky little
cuppa who knows the power he holds all too well. It would brighten up any
lounge or bedroom and should bring a smile to the face of your favourite
coffee-addict come Christmas morning.

** Blue Crow Media are the clever people behind these city maps, which are
populated with fine coffee emporiums for you to visit. There are maps of
London, New York and Paris and can be used to put together a premium coffee
crawl. It’ll be like a pub crawl but instead of crawling you’ll be skipping
and jumping like a caffeine-fuelled loon.

Why not give one of these maps along with a DIY ‘voucher’ for ten cups of
coffee at places of the recipient’s choosing? Then you can frame the pretty-
as-a-picture map as a reminder of your coffee-filled adventure.

This engraved wooden brooch would be a great stocking-filler and at £7 it
won’t break the bank. ‘Twin Peaks’ fans will appreciate that this is how Agent
Cooper takes his coffee but it should go down equally well with a lady who
enjoys a good cup of coffee.

Anyone who prides themselves on making good coffee – and doesn’t have one of
these already – should probably own a Hario V60. Gabi, our head of coffee,
swears by this pour-over design for creating a superior cup of coffee and it’s
pretty good value too.

** What coffee-lovers gift selection would be complete without some shameless
self-promotion?

Giving someone the gift of freshly-roasted, freshly-ground coffee delivered
straight to their door is bound to go down well. And depending on how many
bags you decide to treat them to, they’ll continue to enjoy your gift well
into the new year. That is the kind of kudos that lasts!
