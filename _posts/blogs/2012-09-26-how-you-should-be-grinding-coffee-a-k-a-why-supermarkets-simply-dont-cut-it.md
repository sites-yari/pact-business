**What’s Your Grind?**

How you make your coffee at home should be dictating how your coffee is
ground. The ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach applied by supermarkets simply
doesn’t cut it, and means that you’re probably missing out on a truly magical
cup.

This is why, when our customers sign up to[
YourGrind.com](http://www.yourgrind.com), we ask about the equipment they’re
using at home. It’s not complicated, but it matters a great deal.

So here’s our definitive guide to how your coffee should be ground. I hope
it’s helpful!

**1\. Cafetiere/French Press**

**Grind** : Coarse (7-9)

**Why?** You should be leaving your coffee to sit for 4 minutes before
plunging the cafetiere. That means that the water has a long time to extract
the flavor oil, caffeine and complexity from the grounds. If the grind is too
fine it won’t be caught in the filter and you could end up with sludge at the
bottom of your cup, and a gritty tasting coffee.

**2\. Drip/Filter**

**Grind:** Medium: (5-7)

**Why?** In this method, the hot water is not in contact with the coffee for
as long – perhaps 2 minutes, so you need to offer a greater surface area to
ensure the coffee has enough depth and body. The filters are far finer than
the metal gauze in a cafetiere so there is no risk of a puddle of mud at the
end of your cup.

**3\. Stovetop/Moka**

**Grind:** Fine (3-4)

**Why?** The stovetop sits somewhere between a filter and an espresso. Hot
water boils through the pressed coffee fairly quickly, so you need a fine
grind to ensure that you get all the love out of the beans. It’s important not
to go for a full espresso grind as the moka will let the smallest grinds
through into the cup.

**4\. Espresso machine**

**Grind:** Very fine (2-3)

**Why?** When you make an espresso, high pressure water is forced through the
coffee grounds very quickly, and is in contact with the fine-ground coffee for
less than a minute. You need a very fine grind to ensure that the water can
express all of the oils from your coffee. Interestingly, caffeine takes longer
to be extracted than many of the other flavor compounds so, contrary to
popular belief, espresso typically contains far less caffeine than filter or
French press coffees.

**5\. The Turkish/Ibrik/Cezve**

**Grind:** Superfine (1)

Why? Though Turkish coffee has recently lost popularity in favor of the
brewing methods above, it is arguably one of the oldest widely adopted forms
of coffee preparation. There isn’t enough space to do the subject justice on
this page, but I’d recommend real coffee affectionados to check out the [wiki
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee%22%20%5Cl%20%22Preparation)
on this subject and give it a try. Hold on to your seat, grind the coffee to
dust and brew!
