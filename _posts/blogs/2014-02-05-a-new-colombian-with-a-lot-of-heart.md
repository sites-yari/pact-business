Those who currently enjoy the [Pact Coffee
Randomiser](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2013/10/10/pact-people-power-the-
coffee-randomiser/) may soon be hearing the pitter patter of a new coffee
landing on their doormat. Our latest addition to [the Pact menu
](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees)is a marvellous Colombian that is grown
on the Santa Bárbara Estate and goes by the name La Joyeria #388.

**What’s in a number?  
** The #388 is the lot number that refers to the specific section of the Santa
Bárbara Estate, where this coffee is grown. Diehard Pacters will probably
remember that we had La Joyeria #212 last June. Well this one hails from the
very same estate and is subject to the same quality tests, which bodes well
given the warm reception good old #212 got.

**What’s the story?**  
La Joyeria #388 hails from the main mill on the Santa Bárbara Estate, which
covers 450 rugged hectares in Columbia. It’s made up of all beans from the
#388 lot, which score more than 86 points in the Cup of Excellence. So you
know it’s good.

**What does it taste like?  
** We’d say it boasts a milk chocolate body with mild grape acidity. Some of
us at Pact HQ have also been able to detect hints of sunflower seeds, though
that’s still a matter for debate. Why not see what you think? [You can request
that we make La Joyeria #388 your next coffee here

**Good coffee, good people.  
** One of the reasons we love working with the Santa Bárbara Estate, and the
Echavarria family who run it, is the really decent way they treat their
workers. Besides growing really, really good coffee, they pay staff 30% more
than the mimimum wage, offer free housing and run an extensive scholarship and
financial aid program. This has been set up to help out the worker’s children
and also assists long-standing employees to acquire their own piece of land
when they retire. Just because it seems like the right thing to do.
