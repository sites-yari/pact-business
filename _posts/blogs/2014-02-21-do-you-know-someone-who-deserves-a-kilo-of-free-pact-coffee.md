title: Do you know someone who deserves a kilo of FREE Pact Coffee?
---

**We’ve got a problem.  
** As we grow, it’s getting increasingly tricky to work out exactly how much
coffee we’re going to need each week. We don’t want to run out and disappoint
customers, so we tend to order and roast more than we need. The result is we
often find ourselves with an extra kilo or two of freshly roasted coffee that
is badly in need of a home. And fast.

[Our Pact with our customers](https://www.pactcoffee.com/about) means we’ll
only ever send out coffee that has been roasted a maximum of seven days ago.
That means we can’t simply hang on to all these extra beans – we need to send
them out now.

**So here’s our solution…  
** In a bid to find a silver lining – and do a good deed while we’re at it –
we’re launching the **Kilos for Kindness** giveaway. To put it simply, we’re
going to give our marvellous beans out to deserving folk, a kilo at a time. If
you’d like to nominate someone deserving then [Tweet
us](https://twitter.com/pactcoffee) along with the hashtag
[**#kilosforkindness**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23kilosforkindness&src=typd)

Kindness](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/kilo.jpg?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/kilo.jpg)  
**

We’re talking unsung charities, deserving businesses, busy nurses’ stations
and individuals who go above and beyond in their community. So if you’d like
to put forward an organisation or individual then don’t delay and don’t forget
the hashtag **#kilosforkindness**!

**You’ve got two days…  
** As we said, time is of the essence. So there’s a small window where you can
tweet us your suggestions – you have this weekend! Once Monday rolls around
we’ll select one or more recipients and collect their details from you. Don’t
worry, if your nomination is not selected then there will probably be more
opportunities to put them forward in the future…
