---

You may have considered taking a swerve past your usual cup – or cups – of
coffee. But before you consign yourself to a drab, dragging, coffee-free day
you might want to read on…

  1. **The rumours aren’t true.**

In 2015, a panel of the US’ top nutrition experts released their dietary
recommendations, which included some good news for coffee-lovers. Turns out,
people’s concerns about coffee being bad for them are largely unfounded.
Indeed for lots of us, it might be worth drinking a bit more of the stuff.
Take a look at this article in [The Washington
Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/21/its-official-
americans-should-drink-more-coffee/) to find out more…

  2. **It’s actually good for your health.**

Most people restrict themselves to a couple of cups of coffee a day, but the
experts suggest that drinking more could be beneficial in a number of ways.
Miriam Nelson, a professor at Tufts University,
[reported](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-
report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-
committee.pdf) that consuming as many as five cups of coffee each day is tied
to several health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes. “We saw that coffee has a lot of health benefits,” she
said to the delight of coffee-fans across the globe.

  3. **It’s crammed with feel-good potential.**

Coffee has been shown to release happy-inducing dopamine to the
[brain](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/feeling-
stimulated-by-your-coffee-look-to-the-basal-ganglia-of-your-brain/). And when
paired with a work-out, its feel-good powers are multiplied. Turns out [coffee
helps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11583104) with fat metabolism and
is a proven ergogenic aid. If you’re not fluent in science-speak, that means
it enhances your performance during high-intensity exercise, which means a
better workout and a bigger buzz.

  4. **It comes in sleep-friendly form.**

Keen to benefit from all these lovely health benefits but worried your sleep
will suffer? Worry not. Really good [decaffeinated
coffee](http://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) is now easy to get your hands on.
The process of removing caffeine from specialty coffee involves using CO2,
which acts a bit like a naturally-occurring caffeine magnet. As it’s passed
through the beans, the rich flavours remain intact but the buzz is banished in
a completely non-harmful way.

  5. **It’s easy to get it fresh.**

Coffee tastes best when it’s fresh from roasting. The coffees that you get in
supermarkets are typically months old by the time they’ve reached your basket,
which is why they never like to write the roasting date on the packet. Some
are nicer than others but the flavours dull as the weeks pass; there’s no
beating freshly roasted coffee which supermarket brands find difficult to
supply. And thanks to companies like Pact it’s easy to do coffee right…
