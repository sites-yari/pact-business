Thursday, the 18th of September we’ll be taking part in the Macmillan Coffee
Morning, and showing our support for a charity that offers so much support to
others.

**Why we love Macmillan**

Macmillan Cancer Support is one of UK’s largest cancer care and support
charities. Not only do they help those with cancer by providing financial,
physical and emotional support, but they assist their loved ones too. And the
Macmillan Coffee Morning is a great opportunity to raise money to help them
continue to offer such valuable support.

What started off as a local fundraising event in 1991 spread nationally,
seeing 2,600 people hosting coffee mornings across the UK. In 2013 the number
rose to 153,000 hosts. The event helps raise awareness and funds to help those
in need.

**Come on down!**

We’ll be supporting Macmillan the best way we know how; by making some coffee.
