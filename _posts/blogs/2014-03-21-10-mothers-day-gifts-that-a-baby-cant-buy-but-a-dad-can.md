[![Pact Coffee Mother's Day
Gift](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/mothersreminder.jpg?w=545)](https://www.pactcoffee.com/gifts/new)Babies
and toddlers aren’t up to much really. Sure, they can look cute, get away with
wearing dungarees and eat miniature yoghurts with relentless enthusiasm. But
can they shop for a Mother’s Day gift?

No.

That’s where dads come in.

So, dads, since you’re already having to buy a gift without getting any credit
for it, we thought we’d give you a hand. (I also have more devious ulterior
motives, since my own one year-old doesn’t yet have a credit card.) Below
you’ll find a top ten of presents that any hot hipster mum would really
appreciate. We bet you’ll never guess what number one is…

**10)[Days Are Gone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/days-are-
gone/id681119678) by Haim (£4.99)**  
According to NME “Haim are a rock band who’ve made one of the best pop albums
you’ll hear all year.” Perfect for a spot of momma/baby disco in the kitchen
on a Saturday morning.

**9)[Infinity ring ](https://www.etsy.com/listing/26751114/infinity-
ring)(£23.47)**  
If you’re looking for a gift for a lady then hitting etsy is a no-brainer. We
love this handmade sterling silver infinity ring. Not too girlie, not too
mumsy and it comes in a little gift box too!

**8)[Crosley Floral Mini
Turntable](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/uk/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=5560435980465&parentid=MUSIC-
ELECTRONICS-EU) (£125)**  
Bonus cool points for this one. If you’re feeling flush then this mini
turntable, with its integrated stereo speakers, has major wow-factor.

**7)[Aesop Hand and Body Care Kit](http://www.aesop.com/uk/packs-and-
gifts/sonority-gift-kit.html) (£75)**  
This kit contains Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser, Rind Concentrate Body Balm,
Resurrection Aromatique Hand Wash and Hand Balm. You don’t have to understand
what they do, just rest assured that this is pure, premium pampering.

**6)[Book Rest Lamp](http://www.rockettstgeorge.co.uk/book-rest-house-
lamp-12594-p.asp) (£40)**  
This smart, simple lamp serves as a source of soft light, a home for your
book, a bookmark and a little house for a light bulb. What’s not to love?

**5)[Stripe Robe](http://www.thewhitecompany.com/clothing/nightwear-and-
slippers/stripe-robe/) from The White Company (£50)**  
The White Company are masters of slouchy luxury. This striped rope is a super-
soft way to enhance pyjama time, which (let’s be honest) rolls around pretty
early for true yummy mummies.

**4)[Malin Goetz Rose Scented Candle](http://goodhoodstore.com/store/8422)
from Good Hood (£38)**  
Why not gift wrap this gorgeous candle along with a voucher for an extra long,
extra indulgent bubble bath? Its fragrance of Absolute Rose is positively
dreamy.

**3)[Essence Champagne
Flute](http://www.scp.co.uk/collections/christmas/products/essence-champagne-
flute-pair) (£24 for a pair)**  
Toast the joys of parental bliss with this pair of sleek flutes. Or fill them
with Bucks Fizz and pop them on the breakfast in bed tray you prepare. – You
were going to prepare breakfast in bed weren’t you?!

**2)[Kinto Carat Coffee Dripper](http://www.selfridges.com/en/Home-
Tech/Categories/Shop-Room/Kitchen/Tea-coffee/Cafetieres/Carat-coffee-dripper-
and-pot_244-2001385-KT21678/) (£59.95)**  
Coffee is a mum’s best friend, so why not buy her best friend a nice place to
hang out? The Carat Coffee Dripper is a sweet bit of kit that delivers
seriously rich results.
