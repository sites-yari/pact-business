title: Chocolate & Tahini Cake
---

I love a good old-fashioned collaboration, especially when it involves someone
baking me a cake! So you can imagine how excited I was to hear
[Josie](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/19/introducing-josie/), our
resident copywriter, had a sister-in-law keen to share a recipe for the Pact
blog!

This sister-in-law (let’s call her Molly because, well, quite frankly, that’s
her name), is a holistic nutrition consultant, who also happens to write a
[blog](http://www.theparticularkitchen.com/ "The Particular Kitchen"). Once
she got a taste of [Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees "Pact
coffees") she couldn’t help but come up with a delicious accompaniment to
complement any brew.

Thus, the Chocolate & Tahini Cake was born. Not your average loaf cake, the
tahini in this badboy gives it an incredible buttery richness and depth of
flavour, plus the sesame seeds are packed with magnesium and calcium. It
doesn’t get much better than that, does it?

So without further ado (and since Molly has done all the hard work for me!), I
think it’s time to take a coffee and cake break while you mentally devour this
mouth-watering recipe.

**Ingredients**

Coconut oil for greasing  
40g unsweetened cocoa powder  
180g flour  
1½ tsp baking powder  
½ tsp bicarbonate soda  
½ tsp fine sea salt  
130g tahini  
150g maple syrup or honey  
100g unsweetened apple purée  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
180ml almond milk  
100g plain dark chocolate chips

**Method**

1\. Preheat oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and grease a loaf tin with coconut oil.  
2\. In a large bowl, mix together the cocoa, flour, baking powder, bicarbonate
soda and salt.  
3\. Using a different bowl, combine the tahini, syrup or honey, apple purée,
vanilla and milk.  
4\. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, then fold in the chocolate chips and
pour the batter into the loaf tin.  
5\. Cook for 20-25 minutes before covering with foil. Bake for a further 20-25
minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.

**PACT TIP:** We used normal flour, but Molly’s recipe called for gluten-free.
Also, this cake is perfect for the lactose intolerant among us, but dairy milk
works well too!
