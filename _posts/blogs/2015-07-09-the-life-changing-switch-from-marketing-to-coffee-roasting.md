Our lovely roaster Aissa was interviewed in this week’s TimeOut magazine; did
you catch it? [You can still read the interview online
here](http://www.timeout.com/london/blog/quit-your-job-become-a-roaster), and
find out why she made the jump from a promising career in marketing to being
our roaster _extraordinaire_. Below you’ll find answers to the questions that
were burning in our minds:

Cooler-1-2.jpg)**Pact** : _All of our coffees go by your roaster, what’s your
favourite right now?_

**Aissa:** Ah, how can I chose! If I absolutely have to say which is my
favourite _right now_ (all time would be too hard), it has to be [La
Esperanza. ](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees/la-esperanza)The taste and
clarity you can achieve out of that coffee is really startling!

**P:** _Will (Pact’s Head of Coffee) has said that it can show hints of
blackcurrant boiled sweets. What method do you use to get the best taste out
of your coffee at home?_

**A:** [A V60, hands down.](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/06/12/the-best-
drip-filter-coffee-youll-ever-make/) With it you can make exactly as much
coffee as you want, with the ratio you want. It’s so simple, but you get
amazing results that are rich, tasty, and above all, unique to the coffee.
Once you get the technique right, the sky’s the limit with how much you can
improve your morning!

**P:** _Speaking of improving in coffee: how has taking coffee more seriously
and becoming a roaster impacted your life?_

**A:** It’s given my ambition an outlet it didn’t have before. I can finally
say I honestly love my job! And I’m only at the beginning of my coffee
journey, there’s so much more I can do. Soon I hope to add sourcing coffee to
my skillset, [going to places like Brazil to meet the amazing farmers we work
with.](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2015/07/06/nows-your-chance-ask-our-farmers-
anything/) It’s a great industry to work in if you want to forge your own path
in the world and go where the spirit takes you!

**P** : _Which is very much part of your story! You left your job in marketing
and stepped into the unknown. Do you have any advice for other young people
about to take that step?_

**A:** Throw yourself in. Being young is all about trying different things to
see what works. After too many days waking up and dreading going to work I had
to make the change. It doesn’t even matter if you get it wrong once or twice;
better that than going for 30 years at something you don’t enjoy! I’ve been
very lucky to find such a supportive and friendly company to work with, but
looking for it was deliberate.

**P:** _Thanks Aissa, we’re sure you have roasting to get back to!_
