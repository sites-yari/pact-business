Good friends are faithful companions. They’re there when you need them. They
make you feel all warm inside. And they go really well with coffee. A bit like
a KeepCup…

Okay, okay, this is all a bit tenuous, but the observant among you will see
where we’re going with it…

**For the month of September we’ll be sending a free KeepCup**

**to Pact customers** **who introduce us to three of their friends.**

It’s easy to get your mates on board:

  1. Simply [login to your **Pact Account Page**](https://www.pactcoffee.com/login?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=account&utm_content=keepcup)
  2. Share your personal invitation code.

It takes no time at all, and we’ll help you keep track of your referrals along
the way. So all you need to do is get into the sharing spirit!
