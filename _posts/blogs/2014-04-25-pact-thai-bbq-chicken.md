It’s time to apologise. I’m sorry. I’ve been negligent and biased! I’ve been
favouring the sweet-toothed among us. While I was busy showering them with
recipes for [cakes](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/04/06/french-yoghurt-cake/
"French Yoghurt Cake"), [slices](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/20/pure-
and-simple-peanut-butter-banana-slice/ "Pure and Simple Peanut Butter & Banana
Slice") and [hot cross buns](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/04/16/chocolate-
hot-cross-buns/ "Chocolate Hot Cross Buns"), I left all the savoury souls out
in the cold. Well the inequality ends now, and I’ve got a brilliant recipe to
make it up to you.

It’s easy to see how this happened. Sweetness – especially the chocolatey
variety – naturally complements coffee by strengthening the intensity and
richness of the bean. By contrast, the coffee in this recipe for [Pact
Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffees) Thai BBQ Chicken seems to mellow
the bright Thai accents, creating a sticky, flavourful sauce.

**Ingredients  
**

2 Chicken breasts

Marinade  
120ml honey  
3 cloves garlic  
½ bunch fresh coriander  
2 tbsp dark soy sauce  
3 tbsp fish sauce  
3 tbsp sweet chilli sauce  
30ml strongly brewed coffee  
Juice and zest of one lime

Salad  
Baby spinach (or your favourite leafy green)  
Two spring onions  
Carrot  
½ bunch fresh coriander  
Mangetout

Method  
1\. Using a handheld blender, pulse the marinade ingredients until they form a
liquid sauce.  
2\. Thinly slice the chicken and combine with the marinade. Refrigerate in an
airtight container for at least one hour (the longer the better – overnight is
ideal).  
3\. Heat a non-stick pan with a light oil such as peanut or canola, and fry
chicken pieces until cooked through and slightly seared on the outside.  
4\. Remove chicken and pour remaining marinade in the pan. Gently cook for 2-5
minutes, until it forms a sticky sauce.  
5\. For the salad, thinly slice the spring onion, carrot and mangetout and add
to a bed of spinach and coriander.  
6\. Top the salad with chicken and drizzle with the sauce.

**PACT TIP:** Garnish however you please. I used sesame seeds and some sprigs
of coriander, but chilli slices would also work well.
