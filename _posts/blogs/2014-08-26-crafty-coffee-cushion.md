When one of our customers, [Ben Holah](https://twitter.com/benholah13), (a
creative type who helps his mum run this adorable
[website](http://www.aliholah.com)) asked for a coffee bag for a project he
was working on, we didn’t expect to receive such a wonderful gift in return.

Ben told us how he liked that there are so many things you can do with an
ordinary coffee sack. The material can be used for chair covers, headboards or
even stretched over a canvas, but it was the cushion idea that he liked the
most. It’s also one of the simplest and most effective projects you can do at
home.

**Here’s how he did it:**

  1. Cut two rectangular shapes the same size out of the coffee sack, being careful to match up the grain and anything printed.
  2. Place the two rectangles on top of each other and inside out, then machine sew around three sides.
  3. Turn the fabric out, and fill the cushion with stuffing or an existing cushion. Hand sew the open end and sit back and admire your handiwork.

**Little tip:** You may find you need to use a stronger needle. An upholstery
needle should do the trick.
