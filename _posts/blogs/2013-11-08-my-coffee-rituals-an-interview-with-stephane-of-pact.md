**What’s your name and Twitter handle?**

The name is Maniaci, Stéphane Maniaci.
([@stephane__](http://www.twitter.com/@stephane__))

**How long have you been with Pact?**

It’s been 6 months already

**What’s your favourite brew method?**

At home I make cafetière. At Pact HQ I live on espressos.

**What’s your favourite time of day to make a coffee, and why?**

I really love making my cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Not just
because it means I managed to woke up, but also because the house is quiet, my
thoughts are quiet, it’s a very precious and personal moment.

**Who introduced you to coffee?**

Nespresso… but you know, I had just moved to Paris for my first job, people
were always having their little capsules in the morning. But I got to know the
art of coffee (and the actual taste) at Pact for sure.

**On what day does your coffee taste best, and why?**

A good cup of coffee is your best ally on Mondays.

**What album goes best with a good cup of coffee?**

Serge Gainsbourg – Histoire de Melody Nelson ; it’s a very interesting album,
quiet at some points, loud at others, with some very sophisticated tracks and
Serge Gainsbourg always whispering the storyline in a deep, calm voice. It’s a
little tricky to last the cup for 27 minutes, but I manage.

**Who would be your favourite celebrity, dead or alive, to make a coffee
for?**

Stephen Rapoport! Or Pierre Desproges. Either way, my coffee-making skills are
not good enough yet, but I practice a lot

**What problem can be solved with coffee?**

I think it can be a remarkable brain catalyst. I read somewhere about the
different creative processes of famous writers/artists, and one of them
(Marcel Proust?) would just do cup on cup waking up at 4AM… And he wrote an
acclaimed, classic french novel! That almost no one read. I think if you have
a good relationship with your coffee you can think much better.

**If coffee could give you a superpower, what would it be?**

A superpower?! It keeps me awake, that’s amazing enough. Flying maybe. With
every sip you feel more aware, energy builds up, you start running, you
outstretch your wings… and then the Overground is late.

**Thank you Stéphane for sharing your coffee rituals, if you’d like to be
