[![Pack Coffee Packing
Team](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ateam.jpg?w=545)](http://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ateam.jpg)Those
in the know have heard whispers about an enchanted place, where the aroma of
freshly ground coffee is never absent, music fills the air and people work
industriously in strange and wonderful outfits. This may sound like a fantasy,
but it isn’t. This is The Pact Packing Room.

The Pact Packing Room is presided over by the unflappable Matt. He runs a
tight but fairly rowdy ship. He and his merry band of packers spend the day
grinding up our premium, freshly-roasted beans then popping the coffee into
personalised envelopes for each of our customers. They even sign their names
on the envelopes they’ve packed, just to show they care.

But what makes the inhabitants of The Pact Packing Room tick? Read on to find
out more about Matt and his team – and find out exactly who has been packing
your coffee…

**Packing anthem of choice:** Any [Stax
Records](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RwAoIuzHj0) compilation  
**Special move:** Making sure everything happens when it’s supposed to! Also,
double grinding and sealing simultaneously aka ‘The Grindmaster Flash’

**When I’m not working I like to:** Read Cormac McCarthy novels, eat sourdough
pizza and play drums.

**Favourite ‘Would You Rather’ question:** Would you rather have no one ever
believe anything you say, or never be able to lie?  
**Smallprint:** Sam is neither Maori nor a Mounty.

**Milan (Thrillsy)  
****Hails from:** Melbourne, Australia  
**Favourite coffee so far:** Espresso  
**Packing anthem of choice:** [22 – Taylor Swift

Singing aloud to Taylor Swift, Adele and Lana Del Rey  
**Most overused word/phrase:** “Ludicrous”  
**Favourite ‘Would You Rather’ question:** Would you rather sneeze tomato
sauce forever, or only be able to put BBQ sauce on your food? For the record,
I’d take the latter.  
**Anything else we should know?** I like puppies, they make me happy. Taylor
Swift also makes me happy. Utterly ludicrous, but you can’t help what you
like!

**Georgia (G-Unit)  
Hails from:** Melbourne, Australia.  
**Favourite coffee so far:** Espresso – all variations have been amazing.  
**Packing anthem of choice:** Beyonce, Beyonce, Beyonce.  
**Special move:** I couldn’t pick one, but I’d say we all deserve Hogwarts
letters when it comes to getting all of the orders shipped in time for postage
collection!  
**Most overused word/phrase:** “Would you rather…”  
**Favourite ‘Would You Rather’ question:** Would you rather have pogo sticks
for legs, or corkscrews for hands?  
**Smallprint:** Georgia is also a serious foodie so watch out for her [coffee-
