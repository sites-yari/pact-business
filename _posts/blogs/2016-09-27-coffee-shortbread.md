This coffee shortbread recipe is a twist on a classic recipe and great served
with a coffee cappucino. Wholemeal flour adds a light nutty note to blend with
the expresso and chocolate.

Prep: 15 Mins

Bake: 20 mins

Serves:12

Skill Level: easy

Ingredients:

225g Plain wholemeal flour

125g Cornflour

125g Unrefined light muscovado sugar

2tsp Espresso coffee

50g Dark chocolate broken into pieces

225g Butter (unsalted) cut into pieces

Chocolate covered coffee beans for the decoration

Method:

Preheat the oven to 190 C (170 C fan, gas mark 5). Put the flour and cornflour
into a processor with the butter. Blend together to make crumbs

Add sugar and coffee granules and blend again until the mixture comes together
to form a ball

Knead lightly onto a floured surface. Grease a 20cm square tin and press the
shortbread into the tin. Press a fork around the edges to make a pattern and
prick the surface several times with a fork.

Bake the shortbread for 20 minutes or until the shortbread is pale golden and
cooked through.

Cool in the tin, then cut into 12 bars

Microwave the chocolate on high for 30 seconds or until just melted. Dip the
base of chocolate covered coffee beans in the chocolate and arrange 3 on top
of each coffee shortbread.

Then bring it do the International Coffee Day on the 1st of October at Pact HQ
andâ€¦ Enjoy!
