As of this morning, YourGrind have changed our name to Pact
([www.pactcoffee.com](http://www.pactcoffee.com)). This blog post explains
what this is going to mean for our users, why weâ€™ve decided to change our name
and why, after much deliberation and soul-searching, we settled on the name
Pact.

Whatâ€™s going to change?

For our users, nothing other than a few website addresses will change. The
site layout, account page, contact information and team will all stay exactly
the same.

Why are we changing our name?

When we launched YourGrind back in October, we made a few assumptions.

Our biggest assumption has been proven right; that most people prefer the
taste of fresh coffee, and most people are happy to pay a little over the
supermarket price once they had tried it. In addition weâ€™ve proven that that
free, next day delivery with a single click can stop our customers from
running out.

One or two assumptions were wrong, however. We thought that tailoring the
grind coarseness to customersâ€™ brew method would matter as much as the
freshness of our coffee beans. Quality grinding turned out to be assumed,
rather than something to get excited about. I guess marketers would call it a
â€˜hygiene factorâ€™, and not a â€˜Unique Selling Pointâ€™*. So YourGrind started to
make less sense.

The new name will not change the way we work. Itâ€™s simply that, as a business
in our infancy, we have a chance to get these things right, and we take a lot
of pride in the details. This one feels like a bit of a biggie.

So, why Pact?

In listening to our community, weâ€™ve come to learn the things they care about
most, namely: Our promise to sell the best coffee we can, the strength of our
bond with our community, and our dedication to being open and honest in
everything we do. Thatâ€™s what we hope we have managed to encapsulate with
Pact.

Our Pact with you, our community:

  * We will never cut corners with the quality of our coffee
  * We will be honest and open in everything we do
  * If you have a problem, we will move heaven and earth to put it right
  * You will guide our decisions. If we canâ€™t do what youâ€™d like, we will be totally transparent in explaining why not.

Our Pact with our growers:

  * We will always store treat your coffee with the same love, care and attention that you have
  * We will ensure you are paid at least 2x the Fair Trade rate for your beans
  * If we are successful, we will use our influence to make your lives better, not worse

Our Pact with each other; Colleagues, investors & suppliers

  * We will put our customersâ€™ needs above our own
  * We will push the boundaries of what is possible, and raise the industry bar in everything we do
  * If we make a mistake or spot a problem we will share it with the team to ensure we can all learn from it
  * We will take pride in the details, because everything matters ðŸ˜‰

An amendment to the original blog postâ€¦

In our original blog post we explained that our farmers are paid two times as
much as their Fairtrade counterpart. Recent evidence has shown that this is
not true. Whilst we can guarantee that they are paid more than the Fairtrade
equivalent, we cannot guarantee that this figure is always two times as much.

We are very sorry for this misinformation, for more details please see a more
recent glob post on why we are not Fairtrade and what we are doing to ensure
that we trade ethically.
