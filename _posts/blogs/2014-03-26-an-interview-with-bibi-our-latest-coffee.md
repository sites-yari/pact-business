Pact veterans may remember Bibi, a coffee from India, which was on the Pact
Coffee menu many moons ago. Well, you lucky things, it’s back again!

As a means of introducing you to this decadent-tasting coffee, we thought we’d
give it a quick interview (much like the Q&As we’ve been conducting with [The
Pact Team](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/category/in-the-office/pact-team-in-the-
office/)):

**Pact:** Hello Bibi – how are you feeling today?

**Bibi:** I’m feeling great, lots of get up and go. I’ve got a molasses body
with a hint of pecans and light stone-fruit acidity.

**Pact:** Good stuff! Bibi is a lovely name, where did it come from?

**Bibi:** The plantation, where I was grown, is now run by Faiz Moosakutty.
But the farm was originally named after his mother, Bibi. I believe she was
quite a lady.

**Pact:** Fascinating. So tell us a bit more about where you come from…

**Bibi:** I’m not sure how familiar you are with Karnataka State in Southern
India, but I hail from the Coorg Hills, which is something of a haven for
richly flavoured beans like me. It’s amongst this coffee heartland that you’ll
find The Bibi Plantation, which was my home and the home of my coffee
ancestors.

**Pact:** So, has coffee like you been growing there for a while?

**Bibi:** Yup, since 1960, when it was taken up by the Moosakutty family
(including my namesake, Bibi).

**Pact:** Do the same family still run it today?

**Bibi:** They do. Faiz Moosakutty manages it now, with the help of his wife,
Sonia, and two children, Rihan and Tara.

**Pact:** Just the four of them running a whole plantation?

**Bibi:** No, don’t be silly. There are 100 or so people who work on the
plantation, around 50 of whom live onsite. It seems like a good place to work
since the workers get free housing, electricity and medical assistance. Faiz
also offers the farm’s workers interest-free, flexible loans to assist with
the education of their children. I’ve heard Faiz himself reflecting on running
Bibi, saying, “It is a big responsibility – like looking after a family of 100
people!”

**Pact:** Wow. It sounds like a special place. What’s it like to grow there?

**Bibi:** It’s lovely. Faiz is very particular about growing coffee like me in
an environmentally responsible way. I was grown in the shade of indigenous
silver oaks, jungle figs and rosewood trees. As well as sheltering me, these
also provided a habitat for a vast array of bird and insect life, and the
occasional elephant from the nearby forest!

**Pact:** How exhilarating!

**Bibi:** Absolutely. But I was very well taken care of; no chemical weed
killers were ever used around me and I feasted on micronutrients and compost
and things to ensure I taste really really good.

**Pact:** Well, it sounds like you’re going to be very popular with Pact
customers.

**Bibi:** I hope so!
