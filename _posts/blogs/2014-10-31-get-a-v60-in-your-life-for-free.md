[![Free V60 Coffee
Kit](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/v60blog.jpg?w=545)](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/v60blog.jpg)

If you’re not familiar with the delights of the V60 as a way of brewing world-
class coffee, then welcome. This no-nonsense bit of kit could totally change
the way you make your coffee. Forever.

Our V60 Starter Kit includes filter papers and instructions to help get you
started, and getting your hands on one is simple and – perhaps more
importantly – it’s free.

**For the month of November we’ll be sending a V60 Starter Kit  
****to Pact customers** **who encourage three friends to sign up for a £1 bag
of Pact Coffee.**

We’ve set up a simple, speedy way to get your pals on board:

  1. Simply [login to your **Pact Account Page**](https://www.pactcoffee.com/login?utm_source=pactblog&utm_medium=account&utm_content=viralV60)
  2. Share your personal invitation code.

And don’t worry, we’ll help you keep track of your referrals along the way. So
all you need to do is get sharing.
