At Pact, we believe that if life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Or, to
revise an old phrase, if you sit in houmous, make a pair of shorts out of
coffee sacks.

Don’t think it’ll catch on? Then tell that to our developer, Srik. Don’t ask
us how he managed to sit in hoummous – we’re still figuring that one out. But
with a little help from former fashion designer and current Pact designer,
[Anneliese](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/01/08/introducing-anneliese-and-
her-limited-edition-pact-tote-bags/ "Introducing Anneliese \(and her limited
edition Pact tote bags\)!"), he managed to craft some pretty spiffy sack
shorts.

It’s amazing what you can whip up with a little inspiration and some dip-
stained trousers.

Are we too late for London Fashion Week?

named Robinson Crusoe, medieval urchins and Anna Wintour as his style icons.

addition of a pocket transforms the style from formal to sporty in a flash.
