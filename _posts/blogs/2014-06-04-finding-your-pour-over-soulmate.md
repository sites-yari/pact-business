title: Finding Your Pour Over Soulmate
---

It used to be that if you were “into” a drip you may have taken a fancy to a
[“ninny” or someone a bit “namby-
pamby”](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-
instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=drip%20definition). _Now_ if you like a drip,
it’s likely you’re one of the many coffee buffs falling in love with the pour
over brewing method. And why not? [It’s probably the easiest technique to
master, and yields fantastic results every
time](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/03/26/pour-over-brewing-guide-v60/). A
total catch if you ask us.

The other great thing about pour over is that as far as brewing kits go,
there’re quite a few fish in the sea. There’s a bevy of cool tools to set your
heart a-flutter, it’s simply a matter of finding your perfect match.

Allow us to introduce you to drip’s most eligible bachelors and bachelorettes.
Don’t let their genders sway you, because it comes to coffee, true love knows
no bounds. And while you’re at it, why not browse our

your suitor?

![Pact_V60-2](https://pactcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/pact_v60-22.jpg?w=545)The
V60 is the kind of pour over you could take home to meet the parents.

**V60: The Girl Next Door  
** The V60 is a cheap and cheerful little bit of kit. Retailing at just under
£10, its uncomplicated nature makes it a wonderful launching pad into the
world of pour over. The cone-shaped design features spiral ridges inside the
funnel, which allow the coffee to drain evenly from the base and sides. Its
high level of functionality means using a V60 is not much trickier than
brewing a cafetiere. An added bonus is the thickness of V60 filters; their
incredibly fine nature means that once they’ve been rinsed there’s no chance
of a papery aftertaste. **

Chemex wants to know if you’re ready for this jelly?

**Chemex: Beyonce**  
With its elegant glass body and stylish collar, the Chemex is bootylicious yet
somehow so accessible. It makes a brilliant brew too. This is largely to do
with the thick paper filter. Once rinsed thoroughly, the filter allows the
coffee to sit for a little bit longer, producing a sweeter cup. It’s also a
very easy method to master, as it relies more on the brew method itself than
the pourer’s skill. A Chemex can cost between £30 and £45 depending on the
design, but it’s the style and larger capacity (not to mention appearance)
that make it special.

When Clark Kent meets the Man of Steel.

**Kone: Brains And Brawn  
** Beneath the Kone’s tough exterior beats the heart of a smart and sensitive
soul. The Kone replaces the thick paper Chemex filter with a stainless steel,
laser-cut cone, which costs around £40 and is bought as a Chemex accessory.
The obvious benefit is that there’s no wastage from filters in this process,
however there’re more complex reasons to choose a Kone. The design releases
the coffee quicker, leaving more body and oils in the coffee. This ultimately
creates a brew more comparable to that of a cafetiere, but without the
residue. Because there is no disposable filter, the Kone requires a little
extra cleaning, but it’s worth the effort.

Wave makes the rocking world go ’round.

**Kalita Wave: Flat Bottomed Girls  
** The flat-base design sets the Kalita Wave apart, creating its signature
brew. The Kalita Wave could be compared to a V60, because it’s reasonably
priced (about £20) and requires little faffing around. Unlike the V60’s
vertical ridges, the Kalita Wave filters are – you guessed it – wavy, not the
kit itself. This feature creates air pockets between the wall of the Kalita
Wave and the filter, improving heat retention, which is great because it
generally has a longer brew time.

Woodneck combines function and form.

**Woodneck: Tall, Dark And Handsome  
** Like the Chemex, the Woodneck has a bangin’ bod. The Woodneck’s biggest
point of difference however is its fabric filter, which rests on the glass
decanter using a wire hoop and wooden handle. Many members of the coffee
community will avow the merits of this feature. No paper filter means there is
absolutely no risk of that papery after-taste, resulting in a clean-tasting
cup. To buy a Woodneck is no big deal – you can pick one up for £30 – it’s the
maintenance you need to watch out for. The filter requires quite a bit of
cleaning and must be kept soaked to maintain its shape, but whoever said true
love was easy?
