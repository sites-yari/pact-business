We like to say that our coffee isn’t a commodity, and that neither is your team. But what do we mean by that? It comes down to coffee largely falling into two groups: speciality and commodity. On one side you have Pact Coffee: coffees that score 80 or more out of 100 in cupping tests (where experts smell and taste coffee to evaluate its quality), made from beans that are incredibly low on defects and tend to be comprised of a single variety. On the other, you have popular coffee chains: their coffee is made from damaged, defect-ridden and differently sized beans and are often are blends of different origins as well.Aside from differences in quality, cost (and the way cost is calculated) varies massively between the two types of crop. While speciality coffee is typically sold through various channels including, in our case, Direct Trade, commodity coffee is traded on the stock market - specifically the “New York Board of Trade [NYBOT], the Kansai Commodities Exchange [in Osaka, Japan], the Singapore Commodities Exchange [SICOM] and Euronext [London]”. As in, it’s literally traded as a commodity. And that has widespread ramifications.

**What goes up, must come down... and vice versa**

The trouble with trading something like coffee as a commodity is that there’s a lot of things that can cause prices to fluctuate. And those things range from the physical to the imaginary. Unexpected inclement weather is one, destroying coffee crops and resulting in a mad dash to trade... though a dry season can also have the opposite effect, where bountiful production means prices crash.

But it’s more than just real-life events that affect what price coffee is trading at. Trade speculation also plays a part - anticipated crop shortages prompt some people to “hedge buy coffee contracts”, in order to sell at a profit later. And that results in an ‘imaginary shortage’, putting prices up even further. And, again, the opposite can happen when hedge funds are short-sold (which means traders borrow shares and quickly sell them again, hoping that they can re-buy and return to the lender later - pocketing the difference). This can drastically reduce prices, meaning farmers can even make a loss.

**Crashing prices, worthless crops**

A drastic drop in coffee prices is happening right now. Arabica coffee has slid to below a dollar per pound ($0.99/lb, as of the 20th August 2018) - and this is an astonishing thirteen-year low. It might be difficult to really understand how cheap that is, but consider who gets a slice of that especially small pie. Our Head of Coffee estimates that commodity coffee producers (excluding those in Brazil, due to their highly efficient production rates) have costs of $1.50 per pound. With the market hovering around $1, and the other coffee companies involved in the supply chain taking two thirds of the profit, the farmer will be paying to sell their coffee. They’re losing money with each sale.

But why have coffee prices fallen this time? In this case, it came down to some coffee farmers doing very well - Brazil’s projected crop production is much higher than expected. And a larger amount of coffee being on the market than expected means the overall cost of commodity coffee is devalued.  So a successful crop can lead to a not-so-successful season financially
